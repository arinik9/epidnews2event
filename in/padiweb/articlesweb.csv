TAIPEI ( Taiwan News ) -- After a difficult year for poultry farmers in Yunlin County, another farm was discovered to have been infected with the bird flu virus, leading to prompt action by the local government and the culling of almost 100 turkeys in Sihu Township ( 四湖鄉 ). 
Last week on Dec. 27, a farm worker discovered that a turkey had died of unknown causes, before immediately calling the Yunlin Animal and Plant Disease Control Center. Upon inspection the 11 week old turkey was found to have been infected with the H5N2 Avian Flu Virus. 
The entire stock of 989 young turkeys was ordered to be culled. The operation was completed on Saturday, Dec. 29. 
The Sihu operation brings the total number of poultry farms in Yunlin County ordered to cull their livestock in 2018 to 62. 
The good news is that the number of culling operations in 2018 does represent a decrease when compared to 2017, when 101 poultry farms in Yunlin were forced to cull their livestock over the course of the year. 
UDN quotes Cheng An-kuo ( 鄭安國 ), a livestock specialist at the county's Animal and Plant Disease Control Center, as saying that in 2018, the county was forced to kill a total of 445, 514 birds to combat possible spread of the disease. In 2017 that number was 1,174,520. 
There are reportedly fears that the virus has become localized, and is being spread between farms by wild birds in the region. Cheng says the county will remain on guard to contain future outbreaks, and will maintain strict precautions across the livestock industry.";"EN";2019-01-01 07:31:00;"1 6";

South Korea to ban poultry farms in avian influenza-prone areas02 January 2019 SOUTH KOREA - South Korea will prohibit poultry breeding in areas vulnerable to avian influenza to prevent outbreaks of the highly contagious animal disease, the government said Wednesday 2 January 2019The Korea Herald reported that the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said it will revise regulations for stockbreeders who will require enhanced qualifications, and that breeding of chickens and ducks in AI-prone areas will be prohibited. 
Moreover, farms breeding chickens and ducks within 500 metres of one another will not be allowed. It is hoped that these stricter regulations will curb the need for culls through a reduction in bird flu outbreaks.

Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Wednesday said bird flu is under control in the state and that there was no need to panic. 
` All precautionary measures have been taken to ensure the flu does not spread and human beings do not contract the virus, ' said Modi, who also holds charge of environent, forest and climate change, at a high-level meeting in the state capital to review the bird flu situation. 

Modi said the state was put on alert last week after six peacocks were found dead in Patna Zoo due to suspected bird flu. The zoo has been shut. 

He said there is no possibility of bird flu spreading in the state as there are no reports of any fresh death of birds since December 30. 

Blood and other samples of 26 species of birds from Patna Zoo were sent for tests in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. A second such sample would be sent on Jan 15. ` The zoo will open only after tests confirm negative results, ' he said. 

Bihar Health Minister Mangal Pandey said all health centres in Patna are on alert for the flu and all measures have been taken to prevent the flu from spreading to human beings. ` The situation is fully under control, ' he said. 

In the last week of December, a statewide alert was issued in Bihar over a suspected outbreak of bird flu after two separate incidents confirmed the presence of H1N1 virus in a section of the avian population in the state.

A new drug for the treatment of influenza was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in October 2018, just in time for the 2018 -- 19 flu season. Baloxavir marboxil ( Xofluza ) works against the two types of influenza virus that cause disease in humans, influenza A and B. 
This new drug works differently than currently available drugs, including oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ), zanamivir ( Relenza ), and peramivir ( Rapivab ). These older drugs inhibit the virus by blocking a viral enzyme called neuraminidase. In contrast, baloxavir inhibits a subunit of the viral polymerase, the enzyme responsible for influenza virus replication. Put more simply, baloxavir interferes with the ability of the flu virus to multiply, while the older drugs interfere with the ability of the flu virus to spread within the body. 
This different mechanism of action means baloxavir may be effective against strains of influenza A that are resistant to oseltamivir, the drug used most widely for treatment of influenza. Baloxavir is also active against strains of avian influenza ( `` bird flu '' ). 
Baloxavir reduces duration of flu-like symptoms 
Baloxavir marboxil is taken by mouth. In the gastrointestinal tract, the marboxil component gives way to reveal the active drug, baloxavir acid. A phase 3 randomized, double-blind trial called CAPSTONE-1, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, compared baloxavir to oseltamivir and to placebo for the treatment of influenza-like illness. In this multicenter study ( supported by the manufacturer of baloxavir ), otherwise healthy patients, ages 20 to 64, received either a single dose of baloxavir ( 40 or 80 milligrams, depending on the weight of the patient ); a twice-daily 75-mg dose of oseltamivir for five days; or placebo. In addition, children and adolescents ages 12 to 19 were randomized to receive either baloxavir or placebo. 
CAPSTONE-1 showed that baloxavir reduced the duration of flu-like symptoms by about one day, from an average of 80.2 hours to 53.7 hours. Of note, patients who started baloxavir within 24 hours of symptom onset had a greater benefit from the drug compared to those who started later. Baloxavir rapidly reduced the concentration of influenza virus in respiratory secretions, and did so more rapidly than oseltamivir ( one day versus three days, respectively ). Nevertheless, both baloxavir and oseltamivir were similarly effective in shortening the duration of flu-like symptoms. Baloxavir was generally well tolerated. 
For now, generic oseltamivir is still a good option 
Given the results of CAPSTONE-1, when should baloxavir be used, and should it be used in place of oseltamivir? Baloxavir is approved for the treatment of influenza in patients 12 and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. The main advantage of baloxavir is that a single oral dose is effective, whereas oseltamivir needs to be taken twice daily for five days. However, both drugs reduce the duration of flu-like symptoms. Oseltamivir is now available generically, and may be less expensive than baloxavir. Therefore, unless a doctor suspects that someone is unable or unlikely to complete a five-day course of medication, oseltamivir remains an appropriate choice for the majority of people with influenza, pending additional data or prescribing guidelines.";"EN";2019-01-02 14:31:15;"1 6";

PATNA: A team from public health division under Union ministry of health and family welfare and a doctor from Lady Hardinge Medical College Delhi visited Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, commonly known as Patna zoo, on Tuesday to assist the authorities in preventing the impact of bird flu on human beings. 

Seven peafowls and a khalij pheasant have died in the zoo between December 16 and 29. Officials said the samples collected from the dead peafowls and khalij pheasant and sent to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases ( NIHSAD ) at Bhopal were tested positive for H5N1 influenza. 

Patna zoo director Amit Kumar told TOI that a detailed meeting was held with the experts from Delhi for containing the avian influenza. `` The samples of 26 bird species, including dropping, saliva and feathers, were collected from the zoo and sent to NIHSAD by air on Monday. We have been informed that the samples have been received at the Bhopal laboratory and the corresponding reports will be generated in two days, '' Amit said, adding the samples of soil and water from the zoo premises were also sent to NIHSAD. 

Patna zoo has been shut since December 25 following the death of six peafowls. NIHSAD and Regional Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory ( RDDL ), Kolkata, had conformed that the birds had died due to H5N1 virus. 

Experts from Indian Veterinary Research Institute ( IVRI ) at Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh -- Dr S Nandi and Dr Karikalan -- also visited Patna zoo on December 29 and December 30 to assess the situation with regard to bird flu and chalking out action plan to contain the virus. 

Meanwhile, senior officials in state environment and forests department said first round of sanitization of zoo premises had been completed and the works were still underway to prevent its spread. 

`` Though H5N1 virus is not much harmful for human beings, if not contained in due time, it leads to mutation of the virus, which can cause more harmful diseases to human beings. Thus, we are trying to prevent the spread of the virus outside Patna zoo, '' principal chief conservator of forest, DK Shukla, told TOI. 

Officials in animal husbandry department said works were also underway for a serum surveillance in the 9km radius of Patna zoo to assess the spread of avian influenza virus outside the zoo premises. 

`` We have collected around 500 samples from poultry shops and firms around the zoo premises as well as veterinary college premises and sent these to NIHSAD and RDDL. Incidentally, we have not received any positive reports for avian influenza, '' director of animal husbandry Vinod Singh Gunjiyal said.";"EN";2019-01-02 16:57:00;"1 6";

This is the sixth such cases reported in China in 2018. 
According to the notice, the woman developed symptoms on December 19, 2018, and was admitted to hospital on December 25, and her condition is mild. 
In most human cases of H9N2 avian flu, the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Influenza A ( H9N2 ) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

Most human cases are exposed to the A ( H9N2 ) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected.

Su. 
Mo, who is also state environment and forests minister, held a high-level review meeting with the department and zoo officials on Wednesday to take stock of the situation at Patna zoo, where seven peafowls and a khalij pheasant died due to bird flu between December 16 and 29. 

`` We are adhering to the recommendations of the experts from Indian Veterinary Research Institute ( IVRI ), Bareilly ( UP ), who visited the zoo on December 29 and 30 to assess the situation and chalk out action plan for containment of bird flu.

Mo said. 

He said a decision with regard to opening the zoo for public will be taken after both the reports from NIHSAD come negative. 

The zoo is shut since December 25 following the death of six peafowls from H5N1 virus, which was confirmed by NIHSAD and Regional Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory ( RDDL ), Kolkata. 

Sanitization works were under way at the zoo on Wednesday as well. A statement from the zoo stated that Virkon-S disinfectant was sprayed in the enclosures of hyena, leopards, tiger and lions among other animals.

INDIANAPOLIS -- The Indiana State Board of Animal Health has been working tirelessly in recent years to take preventative steps against any more outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Although there have n't been any outbreaks of HPAI in Indiana since 2016, there still have been some cases of low pathogenic avian influenza. `` On the poultry front, there is always the potential for avian influenza, but the Board of Animal Health works hard to take steps to avoid highly pathogenic avian influenza, '' said Bret Marsh, the Indiana state veterinarian. Marsh said BOAH currently is keeping its attention focused on virulent Newcastle disease, which recently was found in a commercial chicken flock in California. Virulent Newcastle disease can affect the respiratory, nervous and digestive systems in birds and poultry. `` Up until last week, the disease has only been found in backyard birds in California, '' Marsh said. The state veterinarian noted that despite all the work experts and state authorities in California did to work on depopulating the flocks of backyard birds that tested positive for virulent Newcastle disease, crossover to a commercial flock still happened. `` The crossover of the disease between the flocks is a challenge from a disease standpoint because it can cause trade implications, '' he said. Marsh said that due to the disease now being confirmed in a commercial flock in California, the rest of the poultry industry needs to remain on high alert. `` There are teams of people working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help make sure and contain the disease to just one commercial site, '' he said.

Avian influenza, also referred to as bird flu, has spread to one more block of Bihar's Munger district, forcing authorities to order culling of over 15,000 poultry birds there on Friday. The H5N1 avian influenza in the state has so far claimed the lives of 200 birds, including seven peacocks and a khalij pheasant at the Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, referred to as Patna zoo, which has been closed to public since December 25. Unconfirmed reports, however, put the death toll of birds in the state at over 1,000 since the outbreak of the disease in Munger on December 3. The animal husbandry department ( AHD ), however, refuted reports of all avian deaths to bird flu. `` We have been able to successfully contain the disease, which is restricted to the Patna zoo and two blocks of Munger, '' said state epidemiologist Dr Ragini Mishra. The animal husbandry department ( AHD ) on Thursday ordered culling of birds within 1 km radius of Sampatchak village in Jamalpur block of Munger district, nearly 180 kms east of Patna. This follows laboratory test reports from the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, which confirmed death of a poultry bird due to H5N1 avian influenza on Wednesday. As per the AHD survey, around 15,500 birds were to be culled at Mubarak Chak village. District magistrate, Munger, Anand Sharma, however, refused to divulge the figure of poultry birds to be culled, saying the animal husbandry department had done the survey. `` We have decided to cull birds but are awaiting orders from the animal husbandry department. The moment we get the order then only we can give an official press release. Since the AHD has done the survey, you can talk to them directly, '' said Sharma. This is the second instance of bird-culling in the district. The authorities had culled 588 poultry birds at Gorho village in Asarganj block of the district between December 22 and 23, following reports of crow deaths due to bird flu. In Patna, fresh samples of faecal matter of several dead avian species found at the College of Arts and Craft, and the veterinary college, had been sent for tests to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal. `` More than 500 samples of dead avian species, outside the Patna zoo, have been sent for laboratory tests to Bhopal. We are awaiting their results, '' said an AHD official requesting anonymity. Dr Mishra said the bird flu virus had not affected any human beings so far. `` We have sent serum and oropharyngeal swab samples for tests to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. The samples have been collected from people belonging to the risk group who came in contact with the dead birds. So far, none have tested positive, which is a good sign, '' said Dr Mishra. As a precautionary measure, the government had advised people to avoid chicken and poultry products, like egg. Dr Mishra, however, said the virus became inert at 70 degree Centigrade. `` Indian style of cooking in pressure cooker is considered to be safe. There is no risk if one partakes well cooked chicken and boiled eggs. There is no evidence of avian influenza in human beings in India so far, though the disease has been reported from 16 other countries. '' Experts from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute ( IVRI ), Bareilly ( UP ), had visited the Patna zoo last week.

PATNA/NAWADA: Carcasses of birds are still found in different parts of the state despite claims by the state government that avian influenza or bird flu is under control. 

Carcasses of over 12 crows were found in an orchard at Walipur village under Narhat panchayat in Nawada on Wednesday, triggering panic in the district. The orchard is owned by one Mahavir Prasad. 

Carcasses of eight crows have been found in College of Arts and Crafts at Patna since January 1. The college has been closed till January 5. 

Nawada district animal husbandry officer ( DAHO ) Dr Srinivas Sharma said serum samples of the dead crows have been sent to Regional Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory ( RDDL ), Kolkata, for an in-depth analysis and the report is likely to be received within a few days. 

The DAHO, however, said pesticides used by a farmer in his wheat field near the orchard probably led to the death of the crows. 

Meanwhile, a joint team of RDDL, Kolkata and National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases ( NIHSAD ), Bhopal is scheduled to visit Munger, where the presence of H5N1 strains of avian influenza was first detected from viscera of dead birds in six villages of Asarganj block on December 21. 

Vinod Singh Gunjyal, director at state husbandry department, told TOI on Thursday that one of the samples collected from Mubarakganj village in Munger has showed positive results for H5N1 virus that cause avian influenza. 

A team from animal husbandry department visited the College of Arts and Crafts at Patna on Thursday. College employees claimed that apart from crow, carcasses of falcon and owl have also been found there. 

`` Though we have not found symptoms of bird flu in the carcasses of the dead birds found at the college, samples, including feathers and droppings, were collected and sent to NIHSAD, Bhopal, '' said animal husbandry department official.

It has been found that peacock deaths in Patna zoo were due to H5N1 bird fluH5N1 is a virulent form of H1N1 virus. 
Deaths of 650 chickens at a poultry farm in Patna district has started a bird flu scare in Bihar. The chickens died from what is known as H5N1 virus this week. H5N1 is a virulent form of H1N1 virus. The authorities have culled more than 2000 poultry birds in Bihar's Munger District to prevent an epidemic. Culling in Munger District is being followed up by a mop-up and disinfection drive. There has n't been any official announcement to ban poultry products so far. Experts say that a 90-day ban on poultry products is necessary in such areas to prevent fresh infections. The virus usually spreads after contact with an infected bird or bird faeces. Reports of dying chickens and other birds from different parts of the state have added to the panic. Deaths of peacocks in Patna's Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park on Christmas Day were recorded. National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases ( NIHSAD ) in Bhopal has confirmed that avian influenza ( bird flu ) was the reason behind the deaths. The park has since been closed to visitors. Customers have started avoiding purchase or consumption of Chicken products. Hotels are removing chicken dishes from the menu and families are preferring mutton and fish delicacies in marriage ceremonies. The scare is not completely unfounded as currently there are no vaccines available to treat patients if the virus is transmitted to humans from birds. Chicken traders in Patna are trying hard to convince people that processed ( cooked ) chicken is safe to consume. The traders are saying that unlike bacteria, a virus can not infect a dead bird. But this argument has found few takers. State officials are finding it it hard to inspect all poultry farms as the industry is largely unorganised.

Third case of MERS recorded in Riyadh household cluster. 
Today Saudi Arabia's ministry of health ( MOH ) reported a new MERS-CoV case, the third case connected to a household cluster in Riyadh. The notice came in an epidemiologic week 2 notification. The patient is a 33-year-old man from Riyadh who is in home isolation for his MERS-CoV ( Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ) infection. The man did not have camel contact and is listed as a household contact of a previously recorded MERS case. Last week two men, 54 and 87, were also diagnosed as having MERS. The three cases are part of a household cluster. The new case likely lifts on the global total since 2012 to 2,283 cases, at least 806 of them fatal. Jan 7 MOH report CDC notes 7 more acute flaccid myelitis cases, 193 total. 
In an update today, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) recorded 7 new cases of acute flaccid myelitis ( AFM ), bringing the total for 2018 to 193 confirmed cases, the most of any year since the CDC began tracking the mysterious illness in 2014. Thirty-nine states have recorded cases, a number that has not changed since the CDC's previous update on Dec 31. Texas has reported the most cases, 25, followed by Colorado ( 16 ), and Ohio ( 13 ). Three states -- Minnesota, New Jersey, and Washington -- have recorded 10 cases. Illinois Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have each confirmed 9 cases.AFM affects mostly children and follows a seasonal pattern, with activity spiking every other year in the fall. 2014 saw 120 cases, followed by 22 in 2015, 149 in 2016, and 35 in 2017. More than 90 % of patients report mild respiratory symptoms before AFM symptom onset, which typically involves limb weakness and paralysis. The CDC has yet to establish a definitive cause for the 2018 cases, but some previous cases have been connected to enterovirus infections. Jan 7 CDC update As data show high Lyme burden, tick-borne disease law proposedA systematic review of studies on the economic burden of Lyme disease found that the disease poses a significant burden on the United States and other developed countries, researchers from the University of Toronto reported in PLOS One. They focused on 21 studies, which included 10 cost-effectiveness analyses ( CEA ) and 11 cost analyses ( CA ). Most of the CEAs were done before 2003, when a human Lyme disease vaccine was available before it was withdrawn. Seven CAs focused on overall healthcare costs, three targeted diagnostic testing, and one addressed Lyme cardiac treatment. Three CEAs concluded that Lyme disease vaccine was probably cost-effective, but only in endemic areas. Six studies looked at the economic burden from a societal standpoint and found an annual economic impact that ranged from 0.014 US dollars per capita in Scotland ( $ 5.4 million ) to 2.41 US dollars per capita in the United States ( $ 326.6 million ). The authors concluded that the economic burden is significant enough to justify further research into disease control and management. `` A greater understanding of the indirect costs of Lyme disease and cost-effectiveness of interventions in countries where the incidence rates of the disease are increasing, is warranted for guiding Lyme disease evidence-informed health policy decision making, '' the team wrote. Jan 4 PLOS One abstract. 
In a related development, US Rep Chris Smith, R-N.J., on Jan 4 reintroduced legislation that would forge a new national policy on Lyme and other tick-borne diseases and to boost national efforts to fight, treat, and prevent the diseases, according to a press release from Smith's office. The bill has bipartisan cosponsors and follows the November 2018 release of a report to Congress from a US Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) working group on tick-borne diseases. Smith is the founder and co-chair of the Congressional Lyme Disease Caucus. The bill, called the National Tick-Borne Diseases Control and Accountability Act, would create an oversight and coordination office at HHS to oversee federal efforts to prevent and treat the diseases, craft a new national strategy, and require the HHS secretary to report to Congress, promote coordination of federal tick-borne disease activities, and expand research. Jan 4 Rep Smith news release Nov 14, 2018, CIDRAP News story `` Task force spotlights US tick-borne disease as cases set records '' Study links ` presenteeism ' to flu outbreak in cancer patientsA nosocomial outbreak of influenza in an oncology ward likely occurred because sick healthcare workers ( HCWs ) came to work when feeling ill, according to a study detailing the outbreak in the American Journal of Infection Control. The outbreak of influenza A H3N2 took place over 8 days in November 2017 and affected 7 of 10 inpatients on the oncology ward, 16 HCWs ( 14 confirmed, 2 probable ), and 2 visitors. An anonymous survey was given to all HCWs and staff who had confirmed or probable influenza to characterize symptoms, timeline of illness, and reasons for attending work during illness. Sixty-four percent of surveyed HCWs said they reported to work even when experiencing influenza-like illness symptoms; 56 % said they did so because of a sense of duty as an HCW. Others said they felt their symptoms were minor and insignificant. `` It is possible that the nosocomial spread of influenza could have been prevented if the ill HCW either did not come to work or wore a mask, '' the authors concluded. `` It is important for health care facilities to re-educate all employees annually about the importance of avoiding work during peak respiratory symptoms and strict adherence to respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene. `` Jan 7 Am J Infect Control study H5 outbreaks strike again in India, Iran. 
In highly pathogenic avian flu developments, India reported new H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and wild birds, and Iran reported a pair of H5N8 outbreaks at poultry farms, according to the latest notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). In India, which has reported other recent H5N1 detections, the virus struck again at two poultry farms in Orissa state in outbreaks that began on Dec 17. Between the two events, the virus killed 7,228 of 8,300 susceptible birds. The surviving ones were culled as part of response steps. The country also reported H5N1 in house crows found dead in the city of Munger in Bihar state and in two cities in Orissa state, as well as in peacocks at a zoo in Patna, also in Bihar state, an event that was reported earlier by the media. The outbreaks in house crows began between Dec 15 and Dec 18, killed 46 birds, and are now considered resolved. The outbreak at the zoo began on Dec 16, killed 6 peacocks, and is also classified as resolved.

Michael Tome, Harare Bureau 
Suspension of duty on selected commodities among them luxury and public service buses, ammonium nitrate fertilisers, fertilised eggs for hatching and powdered raw milk among other critical goods, came into effect on Wednesday last week, according to a Government Gazette published on Friday. 
Some of the goods on the exemption list include raw wine all for approved importers and manufacturers. 
This is contained in Statutory Instrument 279 of 2018. 
Customs and Excise duty exemptions have been given time-lines with fertilisers and wines suspension running for 12 months from January 01 while fertilised poultry eggs for hatching have six months duty suspension. 
On the eggs issue, the decision is meant to ensure recovery of the poultry sector that was recently hit by Avian Flu. 
`` The principal regulations are amended in section 9Q, suspension of duty on powdered milk imported by approved importers, '' reads part of the gazette. 
One of the major producers Dairiboard's chief executive officer Anthony Mandiwanza, hailed the move saying it was vital in growing the milk industry's production capacity and meeting customer demands. 
`` The extension of duty suspension on powdered milk raw materials is a welcome development as it will assist us in procuring raw materials at a base cost. 
`` The move will grow our throughput as it helps us to improve production capacity especially in this situation where we have a very high demand, '' said Mr Mandiwanza. 
The waiver has also been extended to fertiliser, suspending duty on imported ammonium nitrate fertilisers by approved importers for the next 12 months. 
This instrument comes amid calls to capacitate the local fertiliser industry by the Government in order to meet local demand in the long run with an overall intent to cut the ever ballooning import bill. 
Chemplex Corporation chief executive officer Tapuwa Mashingaidze, commended the move saying it was critical for the farming industry to produce better yields. 
He, however, implored authorities to encourage procurement of local fertilisers in order to capacitate local firms that were being affected by critical shortage of foreign currency. 
`` The suspension of duty on fertiliser imports is a welcome development considering that we are a country that is striving to grow production in agriculture sector. 
`` We, however, continue to advocate for fertiliser procurement ( by farmers and retailers ) process to give priority to local fertilisers producers, '' said Mr Mashingaidze. 
President Mnangagwa has declared the country's future economic development will be anchored on agriculture, mining and tourism among other key sectors, calling for the need to support these economic enablers. 
Presenting the budget last year, Finance and Economic Development Minister Mthuli Ncube, hinted on suspension of customs duty on specified buses for tour operators. 
`` In order to assist tour operators capitalise their fleets, I propose to extend suspension of duty on 75 new buses of a carrying capacity of eight to 55 passengers including the driver, '' said Minister Ncube. 
On fertilisers imports Minister Ncube; `` In order to enhance competitiveness of locally manufactured fertiliser, I propose to ring fence duty free importation of raw materials. 
`` I further propose to ring-fence importation of 10000 tonnes of Ammonium nitrate oil fertiliser under suspension of duty for a period of 12 months from 1 January, '' he said. 
Added Minister Ncube; `` In order to consolidate the gains realised by local industry, Government will renew facilities that have expired, subject to set conditions and, in some cases expand the list of inputs and beneficiaries of rebate facilities. ''";"EN";2019-01-08 22:25:45;"1 6";

Birth control programme for monkeys, a revised regime for sterilisation of stray dogs, and electronic chips to identify owners of deserted pets and cattle are some of the measures the Delhi government's first policy on animal welfare recommends. The Animal Health and Welfare Policy, 2018, also proposes a cowshed at Ghumanhera, ` where cows will be kept along with the elderly in a unique coexistence ', was Wednesday discussed at a meeting attended by Development Minister Gopal Rai. `` There was no such policy before to consider animal welfare in its entirety, covering issuing like the menace caused by monkeys and stray dogs. We aim to keep this policy open-ended so that it can be updated from time to time, '' Mr. Rai told journalists after a meeting with Department officials, animal welfare groups and veterinary experts. The policy suggests tagging pets and cattle with electronic chips so that their owners can be identified, Mr. Rai added. It also provides for undertaking a monkey birth control programme under animal birth control ( ABC ) initiatives and observes that sterilisation of stray dogs under the ABC programme in Delhi through NGOs is not as per expectations. `` It should be further re-evaluated for its shortcomings and necessary measures should be taken to strengthen it, '' says the policy draft. Strengthening infrastructure through a network of veterinary hospitals, polyclinics, aviaries, helpline for distressed animal and birds, and ambulance services are other measures the policy recommends. As per the policy, animal health and veterinary services will be strengthened through 24x7 operational polyclinics in all districts. The needs of birds will also be taken care at district-level aviaries. A veterinary hospital that will be operational round-the-clock will be inaugurated at Tis Hazari on January 16. It has been suggested that the Animal Husbandry unit of Development Department should be renamed the Animal Health and Welfare Department, Mr. Rai said, adding that efforts will also be made under the policy to make Delhi rabies-free through an effective check on stray dogs. Setting up 12 check posts and quarantine facilities at Delhi's borders is part of the policy. `` Our successful intervention in cases of bird flu and glanders noticed in Delhi ensured that the human population was not affected, '' Mr. Rai said.";"EN";2019-01-09 19:48:52;"1 6";

Recent media interest in the animal and human health risks associated with keeping backyard poultry has revealed the need for improved biosecurity education, according to Australian Eggs. Australian Eggs ' Managing Director, Rowan Mc. 
Monnies, said the CSIRO's warning about risks to animal and human health was timely and backyard owners need to understand the responsibilities. `` Anecdotally, there has been an increase in the number of people keeping backyard hens and egg farmers understand the attraction to producing nutritious and delicious eggs '' Mr Mc. 
Monnies said. `` People need to realise that once you 're a suburban ` egg farmer ' there are important biosecurity risks to protect against. `` Strains of avian influenza can occur naturally in populations of wild birds and if a wild duck comes into contact with a domestic hen the virus can be transferred. `` Diseases spread quickly and widely and potential transfer from backyard to commercial flocks can put food security for the broader community at risk. `` It's understandable that people think backyard farming is clean and natural but these set-ups can pose significant problems because of how accessible they are to wild animals. `` Australian Eggs spends a lot of time communicating these dangers to egg farmers but there is clearly a role in getting information out to backyard owners as well. '' Australian Eggs issued a list of 10 things backyard poultry owners should practice to reduce biosecurity risks: Always wash hands after handling chickens or eggs. Keep chickens away from ponds and rivers as water birds are known carriers of avian influenza. Ensure that wild birds can not access the chickens ' feed or water. Diseases can be easily transmitted to poultry by contamination of feed or water. Keep other animals like domestic geese or turkeys, and even cats and dogs, well away as they can bring disease to chickens. Use safe water sources such as town water, good quality bore water or sanitised surface water for chickens to drink. Provide a secure rodent-proof enclosure for poultry as rats and mice are known carriers of disease. Any kitchen scraps fed to chickens must be meat and animal free. When spoiled, these may carry dangerous bacteria. Check hens regularly for anything unusual such as coughing, diarrhoea or swollen eyes. If a chicken is showing signs of sickness, isolate the sick animal from others and seek veterinary advice in a timely manner. Call Animal Health Australia's 24-hour emergency animal disease watch hotline on 1800 675888 if there are unusual symptoms or signs of serious disease.";"EN";2019-01-09 20:00:00;"1 6";

The deaths of scores of birds of different species have led to a bird flu scare in Bihar. Patna, East Champaran, Munger, Muzaffarpur, Gaya, Nawada, Saharsa and Bhagalpur -- from districts spread across the state reports of deaths of various birds, including poultry, crows, pigeons and peafowl have come in. 
The first case of suspected bird flu was reported December 3, 2018 at Gorho village in Munger district's Asarganj block and the next one at Mubarakchak village in Munger's Jamalpur block. Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases ( NIHSAD ) confirmed both to be cases of bird flu, caused by H5N1 virus. 
Sanjay Gandhi Jaivik Udyan, the zoological garden in capital Patna, was affected next, with cases reported on December 16, 17 and 29. 
The state government issued an alert in the last week of last year warning of a likely outbreak of the disease among humans. 
Reports of dead birds have continued in the New Year from districts named above: 

More than 2,500 poultry at a farm in Andhra Chowki village, barely 20 kilometres from Patna ( first week of January ) 
Nearly a dozen crows at an orchard in Chandanpatti village of Sakra block, Muzaffarpur ( Jan 6 ) 
More than two dozen crows near Bata factory in Digha, Patna ( Jan 7 ) 
Dozens of poultry birds at a farm in Saharsa district ( Jan 7,8 ) 

Experts from Bengaluru-based National Institute of Veterinary Epidemicology Disease Informatics, Kolkata-based Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and NIHSAD have visited Bihar to suggest measures to contain the disease, officials at the Chief Minister's Office told Down To Earth. 
Already, about 588 chickens have been culled at Gorho. Most of Mubarakchak's poultry was also culled, said Munger district animal husbandry officer Shrawan Kumar. More than 3,000 chickens have been culled in Munger and Patna districts, officials said. 
The Patna zoo was shut for visitors on December 29, following the deaths of seven peafowl, but tests conducted on them turned out negative. The zoo will reopen after January 20. 
The state government has appealed for calm. Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kr Modi claimed the situation was under control. 
Demand for chicken, though, remains subdued, affecting trade. Health officials have asked people in Gaya and East Champaran to not consume chicken. 
`` Bird flu is mainly spread by migratory birds. The government should take strict action against those hunting migratory birds and traders as well as consumers of these, '' said Arvind Mishra, coordinator in Bihar and Jharkhand for the Indian Birds Conservation Network.

The Sanjay Gandhi biological park, popularly known as Patna zoo, will soon reopen for general visitors and morning walkers, after being shut indefinitely from December 24, 2018. After keeping the zoo shut for nearly a month for general visitors and fitness enthusiasts, authorities at the biological park are considering reopening it next week as Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases ( NIHSAD ) has not found strains of virus which causes bird flu in samples collected earlier from the zoo. Samples of 26 breeds of birds and that of soil and water at Patna zoo were sent a couple of weeks ago to NIHSAD for confirmation of the bird flu virus. Altogether, six peacocks had died at the zoo and as NIHSAD had confirmed it was caused by avian influenza ( H5N1 ), commonly known as bird flu. The government decided to close the zoo to ensure segregation of birds and to spray anti-viral disinfectants. `` We had to keep it closed to minimise the possibility of catching the infection. We got the park thoroughly sanitised, while the experts from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute ( IVRI ), Izatnagar, Bareily too came here and suggested the measures to check the spread of the virus, '' said Amit Kumar, director, Sanjay Gandhi biological park. Recently, NIHSAD has confirmed there's no bird flu virus at the Park and it is been safe for people. On January 15, NIHSAD has collected samples from these birds. `` We are waiting for its reports. It's expected by January 20 and once thenegative report is received, Patna zoo will be reopened, '' Kumar said. Official said the park remained closed during the peak season from December 25, 2018 to January 14. `` Lakhs of Christmas and New Year revelers and the holidayers turn up to enjoy their vacation. But we had to keep it closed to avoid further infection and inconvenience to the visitors. For us the safety of visitors is the top priority, '' Kumar said. Kumar said there is no point of revenue loss as the park is not meant for commercial purposes. Instead it's a live study centre, he said. * Dec 24 2018: Patna zoo was closed after six peafowls were found dead. * Dec. 24,2018: NIHSAD, Bhopal confirmed it died due to bird flu virus * Dec. 25, 2018: Indian Veterinary Research Institute ( Izatnagar ) team arrived * Dec. 30, 2018: Two more birds died at Patna zoo * Dec. 31, 2018: Samples of 26 breeds of birds, soil, water at Patna zoo sent to the NIHSAD, Bhopal. * Jan 15, 2019: NIHSAD confirmed negative reports of tests of the samples * Jan 15, 2019: Another set of samples from Patna zoo sent to the NIHSADSome facts about Patna zoo * It's the only zoo in the state * Was opened for public in 1972 * Accommodates nearly 800 animals of 110 species including big cats and giraffe * Entry fee for the adults: Rs 30 * Entry fee for kids: Rs 5.

Here's an interesting and somewhat quirky Jersey factoid you probably were not aware of: For the past hundred years the Garden State has been in the pheasant business. Those days, however, are now over. Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said the DEP closed the 160-acre Rockport Game Farm in the Warren County township of Mansfield last month after new avian flu control regulations were instituted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. `` We had to make a tough call, a determination that it would just not be cost-effective for use to continue operating the pheasant farm, '' he said. So why was the DEP in the pheasant business in the first place? He explained part of the mission of the Division of Fish and Wildlife is to provide hunting opportunities for Jersey residents and pheasant hunting has long been very popular in this part of the state. `` It's fun for people to hunt and it's also good to eat, '' Hajna said. He said after it was determined the farm would be shut down, several hundred thousand pheasants were released. The state is now accepting expressions of interest for repurposing the farm. `` We 're hoping to get lots of good ideas. This is a very rural area of the state with rolling hills and lots of farmlands. Some possibilities could be a farm, a poultry farm, tree nursery or even a vineyard, '' Hajna said. Hajna pointed out that repurposing does n't mean a developer is going to come in and build townhouses. `` We 're not selling the farm. We 're looking for a lease opportunity that will generate revenues for the Division of Fish and Wildlife. '' He stressed just because the pheasant farm has been closed it does n't mean they wo n't still be around. `` We still are buying pheasants from other areas for release, so the actual hunting opportunity for pheasants has not been impacted whatsoever.

The Chinese Lunar New Year or Spring Festival begins on Tuesday 5 February 2019, and marks the start of the Year of the Pig. The celebrations end with the Lantern Festival on the 19 February 2019. 
Human cases of avian influenza have recently been reported in China, and historically there have been more cases at this time of year. Cases have originated from several provinces and municipalities across Mainland China, and there have been a small numbers of cases among Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan residents who have travelled to mainland China. 
The majority of reported human cases in China have had close contact with wild birds or poultry. Although the risk is very low, Public Health England ( PHE ) and the National Travel Health Network and Centre ( NaTHNaC ) are reminding UK travellers to protect themselves from avian flu by minimising exposure to wild birds and poultry. 
Dr Dipti Patel, Director at NaTHNaC, said: 

Although the risk to UK residents travelling to the affected areas remains very low, anyone planning to visit China, Hong Kong SAR or Taiwan should minimise their exposure to any birds such as wild birds or at live poultry markets, as a precaution. 
We also strongly recommend that people see their GP, pharmacist or travel health clinic ideally 4 to 6 weeks before travel, to check they are in-date with any recommended vaccinations and discuss any other potential health risks. 

Dr Gavin Dabrera, PHE's avian flu expert, explained: 

People can develop avian flu following close contact with poultry or other birds that are infected with the virus. We strongly urge people travelling to China to avoid visiting live bird and animal markets ( including ` wet ' markets ) and poultry farms, avoid touching dead or dying birds and maintain good hand and personal hygiene. 
If travellers experience flu-like illness within 10 days of returning from China, they should call their GP or NHS 111 and report their recent travel. 
While the risk to the UK from avian flu is currently seen as being very low, PHE has arrangements in place to deal with emerging diseases. This includes the detection and investigation of suspected cases, and the management of confirmed cases and their contacts. 

Travellers can check NaTHNaC's Travel.

PATNA: The Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, known as Patna zoo, is likely to reopen for visitors in a few days as the latest report by National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases ( NIHSAD ) ruled out the presence of avian influenza in birds and other zoological samples sent for test earlier this month. 

The zoo was shut on December 25 after NIHSAD at Bhopal and Regional Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory ( RDDL ), Kolkata, confirmed that the six peafowls had died due to H5N1 virus. 

This was the second successive report ruling out H5N1 virus in the samples sent from Patna zoo. As per standard operating protocol of the Union ministry of animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries, civilians can be allowed at any place if two consecutive reports are negative for H5N1 virus. 

`` A third set of samples comprising swab, droppings and feathers of 26 birds as well as soil and water of Patna zoo were sent to NIHSAD on January 15 for H5N1 virus test. The reports of the sample arrived on Tuesday and they are negative, '' zoo director Amit Kumar told this newspaper. 

`` The second set of samples sent to NIHSAD on December 31 had also tested negative. According to standard procedure, the next step will be to obtain a clearance certificate from state animal husbandry department before opening the zoo to general public. For this, a committee will be formed comprising members of state government, Patna zoo and animal husbandry department. We are working on this, '' he said. 

According to the inspection report presented by experts from Indian Veterinary Research Institute at Izatnagar in UP, the zoo can be reopened for visitors after 21 days from the last death of any bird in the park. 

`` Various measures have been taken to boost sanitation and prevent further contamination. Anti-infection medicine has been sprayed in the vicinity of hyena and leopard cage, hospital campus and grain storage. Blowgun firing is done near bird cage numbers 25, 26 and 27. The soil patch has been changed at a couple of places and lime powder is sprinkled on the ground, '' Amit said. 

Meanwhile, fitness enthusiasts and wildlife lovers are eagerly waiting for the zoo to reopen. `` My husband and I are a regular at the zoo for morning walks. We have been going to Rajdhani Vatika since the zoo was closed. We are eagerly waiting for the zoo to reopen as it is more spacious and better suited for long walks, '' said Putul, a resident of Anisabad.";"EN";2019-01-23 00:55:00;"1 6";

Study: Flu vaccine offers 68 % protection in Canada, 72 % against H1N1Today in Eurosurveillance, researchers published the first estimates of vaccine effectiveness ( VE ) for the 2018 - 19 seasonal flu vaccine administered in Canada, showing that overall VE was 68 % in a season driven by influenza A ( H1N1 ) viruses and 72 % against the predominant strain. The study was based on 1,518 eligible specimens collected by the Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance system from Nov 4, 2018, through Jan 12, 2019. Among those specimens, 661 ( 44 % ) tested positive for influenza, including 656 ( 99.2 % ) specimens typed as influenza A, 4 ( 0.6 % ) as influenza B, and 1 ( 0.2 % ) as an influenza A/B co-infection. For all flu types, VE was 68 %. For the H1N1 strain alone, it was 72 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 60 % to 81 % ). According to the study, adjusted VE estimates against H1N1 were 91 % ( 95 % CI, 67 % to 98 % ) in children ages 1 to 8 years, 71 % ( 95 % CI, − 60 % to 95 % ) in 9 - to 19-year - olds, 68 % ( 95 % CI, 51 % to 80 % ) in adults ages 20 to 64, and 65 % ( 95 % CI, − 1 % to 88 % ) in adults 65 and older. The estimates for 9 - to 19-year - olds and those 65 and older, however, were not statistically significant. All influenza vaccines manufactured for Canada for the current flu season were egg-based, and more than 95 % were the inactivated vaccine. `` Our 2018 / 19 VE estimate of 72 % ( 95 % CI: 60 to 81 ) against influenza A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 viruses is comparable to a preliminary report from Australia using the same vaccine component for their 2018 season ( 78 % ), '' the authors concluded. Jan 24 Eurosurveillance study FDA approval expands Fluzone quadrivalent indication for youngest kids. 
Sanofi Pasteur announced yesterday that the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has approved an expanded age indication for the use of the 0.5-milliliter ( mL ) dose of Fluzone quadrivalent flu vaccine for children ages 6 through 35 months. In a statement, David Greenberg, MD, the company's regional medical head for North America, said the expanded indication will streamline immunization efforts for pediatricians by allowing the same 0.5-mL dose for the youngest children as for other children. The company said doctors will have both the 0.25-mL dose and the 0.5-mL dose available for the expanded age indication for the upcoming 2019 - 20 season. Sanofi said the FDA's approval was based on a phase 4 safety and immunogenicity study in nearly 2,000 children that suggested one or two 0.5 mL doses of children ages 6 through 35 months had a safety profile that was similar to the smaller dose, with no new safety concerns and with a robust immune response. Jan 23 Sanofi press release CDC: Three in 2017 sickened with listeriosis after eating caramel apples. 
Today's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports ( MMWR ) includes information on a cluster of listeriosis patients sickened after eating caramel apples in the fall of 2017. The apples were sold in clamshell packs at grocery store chains throughout the country, and the cases occurred in Illinois, Iowa, and Michigan. All case-patients were men from 55 to 71. All three were hospitalized for listeriosis, but none died. Investigators did not find the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes on any caramel apples collected during the outbreak investigation nor during testing of apple production environments. Nevertheless, the authors said the epidemiologic evidence indicated that caramel apples were the cause of the outbreak. Grocery store recipes collected from the patients showed all three had eaten the same caramel apples in the weeks prior to symptom onset. `` All outbreak-associated ill persons consumed a specific brand of a relatively uncommon food product in the month before their illness onset, and all were infected with indistinguishable L. monocytogenes strains, '' said the authors, who are from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state health departments. `` Caramel apples were previously implicated in a large multistate outbreak of listeriosis during 2014 - 2015, caused by contamination of whole apples. '' Jan 24 MMWR study Avian flu outbreaks reported in India, Taiwan, Dominican Republic. 
In the latest avian flu developments, India reported more highly pathogenic H5N1 detections in poultry and in wild birds, Taiwan reported more highly pathogenic H5N2 outbreaks at poultry farms, and the Dominican Republic reported an outbreak involving low-pathogenic H5N2, according to separate notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). In India, the agriculture ministry reported two more H5N1 outbreaks in backyard poultry, both in Bihar state. One began on Dec 15, and the other started on Jan 3. Combined, the outbreaks killed 57 of 4,046 susceptible birds, which were culled to curb the spread of the virus. So far, the source of the virus has n't been determined. In late December, the country reported a similar outbreak at a different location in Bihar state, the first appearance of H5N1 in India since June 2018. Also, India reported four more H5N1 events in wild birds, three involving house crows found dead in Bihar state and one in an Indian pond heron found dead in Orissa state. In total, 39 bird deaths were reported. Earlier this month, the country reported finding the virus in house crows in both Bihar and Orissa states. Taiwan's new H5N2 outbreaks are part of poultry detections that have been occurring since 2015. The latest events struck commercial poultry farms in Changhua and Yunlin counties, with start dates on Dec 6 and Jan 9, respectively. The report did n't note any poultry deaths but said 11,719 birds were destroyed at the two locations. Jan 24 OIE report on H5N1 in Indian poultry Jan 24 OIE report on H5N1 in India wild birds Jan 23 OIE report on H5N2 in Taiwan. 
Meanwhile, animal health officials in the Dominican Republic said low-pathogenic H5N2 was found in an outbreak involving backyard birds that began on Nov 2 in the city of Puerto Plata. Affected birds included hens, ducks, turkeys, and guinea fowl. The virus killed 745 of 1,126 susceptible birds, and authorities destroyed the survivors as part of the outbreak response.

Winter is known to take a toll on our health, and often coincides with flu season, which, experts say is well underway across China. 
The good news? 
No abnormal symptoms have been seen so far, particularly no cases of the deadly bird flu. 
`` The H7N9 bird flu cases usually happen in this season. But over the last year, we have n't even found a single case. This is thanks to efforts like regulating livestock market and breeding, '' said Li Zhongjie, researcher at China Center for Disease Control And Prevention.

As always, authorities advise getting an annual flu shot sooner rather than later. But flu vaccines were in short supply at the beginning of this season. Officials did not connect that shortage to a local vaccine factory scandal in July, saying now there are enough for use. 
`` The vaccine strains were from the WHO, the standard regent for detection was purchased from abroad. These purchases were delayed for two months longer than usual this year. But so far we 've purchased 14.26 million, 10.97 million were used, and we have more left, '' said Lei Zhenglong, deputy director of the disease control bureau of National Health Commission.

Taipei, Jan. 26 ( CNA ) Samples taken from some 100 dead chickens recently found discarded near a stream in Hsinchu have come back testing positive for avian influenza infection, the county's Animal Disease Control Center said Saturday. Peng Cheng-yu ( 彭正宇 ), an official with the disease control center, said the carcasses have been identified as infected with the H5 strain of avian flu, a pathogenic virus that is causing global concern as a potential pandemic threat. Farms inspected within three kilometers of the site were disinfected and cleared of any virus activity, Peng said. According to the official, the dead birds were found abandoned near a stream in the county's Xinfeng Township by members of the public earlier this week, who then reported the incident to authorities. The county's Environmental Protection Bureau has teamed up with the local police to determine from which farm the birds originated to ensure that other poultry have not been compromised, he said. Those found guilty of endangering public health by abandoning animals or failing to report large numbers of potentially infected animals may face penalties of up to NT$ 1 million ( US$ 32,500 ) under the Statute for Prevention and Control of Infectious Animal Disease, Peng warned. According to Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine ( BAPHIQ ) statistics, two poultry farms in Taiwan have been infected with avian flu so far this year, during which 11,271 birds have been culled.

`` Researchers are looking for new ways to stop these outbreaks and to treat people who become infected and develop Ebola virus disease. The development of preventive vaccines for Ebola is a top global public health priority, '' said Paul Spearman, MD, of Cincinnati Children's and lead investigator of the trial. He is director of the Division of Infectious Diseases. 
Ebola is a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by infection with one of the Ebola viruses. Ebola virus disease has a wide-ranging fatality rate of about 30-90 percent, depending on virus species. The hemorrhagic fever can affect organs, damage blood vessels and the body's ability to regulate itself. Once a person is infected with an Ebola virus, it can then be spread from person to person through close contact with infected body fluids. Ebola viruses have generally caused infections in a small number of people in Central Africa each year, although there have been several Ebola outbreaks since 2013. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa that began in 2013 made more than 28,000 people sick, causing more than 11,000 deaths and spread into other countries around the world. A current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has so far caused more than 700 confirmed and probable cases of Ebola virus disease. Blueprint for Immunity. 
Researchers on the current study will examine how the vaccines work in the body to stimulate responses in the immune system that may protect against Ebola viruses. Laboratory evaluations of the vaccines are led by Karnail Singh, PhD, in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Cincinnati Children's. Singh's laboratory focuses on the development, characterization and evaluation of candidate vaccines for Ebola virus disease. The trial is studying two experimental Ebola vaccines; the Ch. 
Ad3-EBO-Z vaccine and the MVA-BN ® - Filo vaccine. These are weakened live-vector vaccines that can not effectively grow in human cells but generate strong immune responses to Ebola virus proteins. Spearman said previous laboratory research shows combining the two vaccines is a promising approach to generate potentially protective anti-Ebola responses. A major goal of the current trial is to use systems biology tools that provide a biological blueprint of the responses. This will provide a better understanding of why adding a MVA - BN ® - Filo booster after priming the body with Ch. 
Ad3-EBO-Z enhances the character and magnitude of immune response. This study will enroll up to 60 healthy volunteers between 18 to 45 years of age. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. All participants will receive one dose of the Ch. 
Ad3-EBO-Z vaccine followed by a second dose eight days later of either: 1 ) the Ch. 
Ad3-EBO-Z ( 20 participants ); 2 ) the MVA-BN ® - Filo vaccine ( 20 participants ), or 3 ) a placebo ( 20 participants ). Participants will be monitored closely for adverse events for six months after initial vaccination during at least 12 clinic visits. During these visits, volunteers will receive blood tests to evaluate potential immune responses to both of the experimental vaccines. Each volunteer will participate in the trial for approximately seven months. For information about enrolling to volunteer for the study, click here or call 513-636-7699.

They reviewed 63 separate reports from 56 studies that evaluated, as compared to conventional molecular tests, 13 commercial molecular rapid test products. Pooled sensitivity was 90.9 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 88.7 % -93.1 % ) and pooled specificity was 96.1 % ( 95 % CI, 94.2 % -97.9 % ) for detecting either flu ( 29 ), RSV ( 1 ), flu virus and RSV ( 19 ), and a viral panel that included flu and RSV ( 14 ). The 15 clinical impact studies varied widely by size and quality, leading to results that were inconclusive. However, the team found high-quality evidence that rapid testing might decrease the length of hospital stay and may increase the use of oseltamivir in patients who test positive for flu. The group did n't observe any effect on antibiotic prescriptions, duration of antibiotic therapy, use of in-hospital isolation measurements, or the number of hospital admissions. `` We therefore suggest to consider implementation of rapid molecular tests within hospital settings and recommend performance of high-quality randomized studies, '' researchers concluded. Jan 28 Clin Infect Dis abstract Avian flu outbreaks strike birds in Nigeria, South Africa, Russia. 
In the latest highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak developments, Nigeria and South Africa reported more H5N8 outbreaks on farms and Russia reported another H5 outbreak, this time involving a turkey farm, according to separate notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). Nigeria's outbreak, its second of the year involving H5N8, began on Jan 10 and affected a farm housing 13-week-old pullet in Bauchi state, located in the central part of the country. The virus killed 8 of 2,000 birds, and the surviving ones were culled as part of the outbreak response. Meanwhile, South Africa reported five H5N8 outbreaks at ostrich farms in Western Cape Province that began between August and November of 2018. Taken together, the virus killed 133 of 6,533 susceptible birds at different locations, one of which was the city of Cape Town. The surviving birds were slated for stamping out. Elsewhere, Russia's agriculture ministry reported another in a small but steady stream of H5 outbreaks affecting poultry in the west of the country. The latest event started on Jan 21 at a turkey farm in Rostov province, killing 51 of 16,177 birds. The rest were culled to curb the spread of the virus. Jan 28 OIE report on H5N8 in Nigeria Jan 28 OIE report on H5N8 in South Africa Jan 28 OIE report on H5 in Russia CDC calls Listeria outbreak tied to pork rolls over. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) today called an end to its investigation of a Listeria outbreak tied to Vietnamese pork patty rolls that hospitalized four people in as many states. The agency did not add any cases to the outbreak total since federal officials first announced it on Nov 21, 2018. Officials in Louisiana, Michigan, Tennessee, and Texas reported cases. The date of first symptoms ranged from Jul 1, 2017, to Oct 24, 2018. Patients were women from 35 to 84 years old. `` As of January 29, 2019, this outbreak appears to be over, '' the CDC said. On Nov 20, the 165368 C. Corporation of Houston, doing business as Long Phung Food Products, recalled ready-to-eat pork products after the Listeria cases were announced. The bacterium is one of the more lethal to cause foodborne disease. Jan 29 CDC update Takeda's new dengue vaccine shows promise in late-stage trial. 
Today Japanese drug maker Takeda announced promising results of late-stage clinical trials of TAK-003, the company's new dengue vaccine. According to Reuters, the vaccine performed well in the phase 3 TIDES trial, which assessed the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in 20,000 children in Asia and Latin America. Takeda officials said blood samples taken before the trial began established whether children had been previously exposed to dengue, a step missed by Sanofi Pasteur when they were testing Dengvaxia, their dengue vaccine. Only after it had been approved for use, Dengvaxia was found to enhance dengue infections in children who were dengue-naive at the time of vaccination. Takeda has not released details on how the vaccine performed, but told Reuters there were no significant safety concerns, and they would follow up with trial participants for 3 years. The company said it will be publishing full results from the trial in peer-reviewed journals.TAK-003 is administered in two doses, given 3 months apart. The vaccine is based on a weakened dengue 2 virus, with genes from dengue 1, 3, and 4. Jan 29 Reuters story Jan 29 Takeda press release";"EN";2019-01-29 07:00:00;"1 6";

Taipei, Jan. 29 ( CNA ) A total of 11,104 chickens in Yunlin County were culled after the farm on which they were being raised was confirmed to be infected with the highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus, the county's Animal and Plant Disease Control Center said Tuesday. Cheng An-kuo ( 鄭安國 ), an official at the center, said it received a report of abnormal deaths of chickens at the farm in Dongshih Township and immediately collected tissue samples from the animals Jan. 26. The samples were then analyzed and confirmed to be the H5 strain of avian flu, Cheng said. This is not the first time this particular farm has been hit by the disease, the last time being only last year, when the farmer also had chickens culled because of avian flu, the official said. Cheng urged farmers to report any cases of abnormal poultry deaths to the authorities as quickly as possible to prevent the possible spread of the disease. According to Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine statistics, three poultry farms in Taiwan have been infected with avian flu so far this year, leading to the culling of 22,375 birds.

The outbreak of the virulent H5 strain of avian flu in Uganda in January 2017 significantly crippled the poultry industry, which is driven by exports into the region. Avian flu is a highly infectious disease that affects many animals, including humans, rats, mice and dogs. The outbreak was first detected in wild ducks on the Ugandan side of Lake Victoria at Lutembe beach near Entebbe in Masaka and Wakiso districts.

THE deaths of penguins at the Halifax Island beach some 10 kilometres outside Lüderitz near Diaz Point, about 100 metres off the mainland, are suspected to be linked to bird flu. The ministry of fisheries ' spokesperson, De Wet Siluka yesterday confirmed that symptoms of bird flu were detected from the live and rehabilitated penguins ' observations, and it is suspected it might be the cause of the penguins ' deaths. The recent inspection, conducted on 27 January, found similar symptoms in one of the swift tern birds on the same island, he added. But, Siluka said, central veterinary laboratory results expected soon were still needed to determine the exact cause of the seabirds ' mortalities. The deaths of the penguins were discovered late last month, and about 250 mostly adult birds have been reported dead. He said the ministry is committed to visiting the island on a regular basis, despite rough weather conditions, to collect dead penguins ' bodies, and burn them to avoid the further spread of the suspected cause of death. `` We are also collecting and rehabilitating the infected penguins at our intensive care facilities, '' he continued. Siluka said the biggest worry is that penguins are already endangered species. `` Besides good population growth recorded on this island, here comes another catastrophe to the penguins ' population growth, '' he stated. Halifax Island, according to the ministry's spokesperson, is the third most important breeding site for African penguins, and is home to about 2500 penguins that contribute to the entire Namibian population of about 26000 penguins. Other seabirds breeding on the island include crowned cormorants, swift terns and Hartlaub's gulls. Penguins are part of a food web, and basically feeding regimes of other seabirds as well, and the ministry was thus working around the clock to establish the cause of death.";"EN";2019-01-31 12:24:42;"1 6";

Kenya says it will lift the ban on poultry imports from neighboring Uganda. It follows reports that the outbreak of bird flu in Uganda was now under control. Kenya's Livestock Principal Secretary Harry Kimutai announced the decision this week. But that is however dependent on a confirmation from the World Health Organization ( W.H.O ). Kenya imposed the ban after the outbreak of Avian Flu was first detected in ducks on the Uganda's side of the lake Volta at Lutembe beach near Entebbe. Avian influenza virus occurs naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other birds and animal species.

CDC confirms 9 new acute flaccid myelitis cases for 2018The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) today confirmed 9 new cases of the polio-like condition known as acute flaccid myelitis ( AFM ), boosting the 2018 numbers to 210. The agency also noted that 7 patients so far this year are under investigation for AFM. Forty-one states have confirmed AFM cases in 2018, which is one more than the CDC reported in its most recent update on Jan 22. Texas has reported the most, with 29. Colorado has 16 cases, Ohio has 13, and Washington state and California have 11. Minnesota and New Jersey have recorded 10. The condition has been following an every-other-year pattern. The CDC first started tracking the disease in August of 2014, and that portion of the year saw 120 cases. In 2015 the agency confirmed 22 cases, in 2016 there were 149, and 2017 saw 35 cases. The 210 cases confirmed so far for 2018 have set a record.AFM affects the spinal cord, leaving patients -- almost always children -- with partial or total limb paralysis or muscle weakness. The cause of the disease is unknown, but 90 % of patients report upper respiratory virus symptoms in the weeks prior to limb weakness. In previous years the syndrome has been tied to enterovirus infections. Feb 4 CDC update CDC estimates low flu vaccine protection last season still saved many lives. 
An end-of-season 2017 - 18 flu vaccine effectiveness ( VE ) estimate by a team led by CDC researchers found an overall VE of 38 % against medically attended influenza and 22 % for the H3N2 strain, but even this fairly low level of protection still saved thousands of lives, according to a Feb 2 study in Clinical Infectious Diseases. The investigators used national age-specific estimates of 2017 - 18 flu vaccine coverage and disease burden and measured VE against medically attended flu confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing. They used a test-negative design. Last year's season was severe, and the H3N2 strain was predominant.VE against all strains was 38 % ( 95 % confidence internal [ CI ], 31 % to 43 % ). For H3N2 VE was 22 % ( 95 % CI, 12 % to 31 % ), for 2009 H1N1 it was 62 % ( 95 % CI, 50 % to 71 % ), and against influenza B it was 50 % ( 95 % CI, 41 % to 57 % ). In addition, the researchers estimated that vaccination prevented 7.1 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109,000 hospitalizations, and 8,000 deaths. Vaccination prevented 10 % of expected hospitalizations overall and 41 % among children 4 years old and younger. In an accompanying commentary, Kathleen M. Neuzil, MD, MPH, and Meagan C. Fitzpatrick, PhD, of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said, `` The results are qualitatively similar to a previous model that looked at a range of effectiveness estimates and applied them to US burden. In fact, the model published here is considerably more conservative, and represents the lowest possible bound for estimates of disease averted. `` They add that the data reinforce the importance of routine seasonal flu vaccination.

Feb 2 Clin Infect Dis commentary Deadly Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria grows to 213 cases. 
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) said late last week it is scaling up its response efforts in Nigeria after a Lassa fever outbreak affecting people in 16 states has grown to 213 confirmed cases, including 41 deaths. All of the cases and deaths have been recorded since Jan 1. The WHO said of the outbreak, `` This represents a significant increase in the number of cases reported compared to the same period in 2018. '' Nigerian officials reported the outbreak to the WHO on Jan 21. In response, the WHO intensified its technical assistance to local and national authorities. Peter Clement, MD, MPH, the WHO officer in charge for Nigeria, said, `` WHO reorganized its staff to provide assistance to each of the response pillars and directed field offices to assist in outbreak investigation, coordination and response activities at the state level. '' `` WHO is supporting coordination, enhanced surveillance, contact tracing, and risk communication. We are also mobilizing experts to support case management and detailed epidemiological analysis to monitor situation in the affected states. '' Feb 1 WHO news release WHO reports 339 cases in Jamaican dengue outbreak. 
Jamaican health officials have reported a rise in dengue cases to the WHO and have declared an outbreak, with 339 suspected and confirmed cases, including 6 deaths, reported from Jan 1 through Jan 21, the WHO said today in a statement. Lab tests have identified dengue virus 3 ( DENV3 ) as the circulating serotype. For 2018, Jamaica's dengue cases were 4.5 times higher than the previous year, piling up 986 suspected and confirmed cases, 13 of them fatal. For the new year, cases reported have passed the epidemic threshold. Jamaica's last major outbreak occurred in 2016, registering more than 2,200 cases, in which DENV3 and DENV4 circulated. Toward the end of 2018, the hot spots were Kingston and Saint Andrew parishes, and in 2019, the largest number of cases have been reported from Saint Catherine parish, the WHO said. Other countries and territories in the Caribbean region are also reporting dengue increases, including Guadeloupe, Martinique, and St. Martin. However, the circulating serotype in St. Martin and Guadeloupe is DENV1. Feb 4 WHO statement H9N2 avian flu infects boy from China's Hunan province. 
China has reported a human H9N2 avian flu case involving a 2-year-old boy from Hunan province in the south central part of the country, according to a report yesterday from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease news blog. The boy is from Changde City and the report said on Dec 27 his illness symptoms were mild and he had a history of exposure to live poultry. The boy's infection raises China's number of H9N2 cases in 2018 to seven. H9N2 cases are typically mild and often reported in children.H9N2 is enzootic in China's poultry, and exposure to live poultry is a known risk factor for contracting the virus. According to the WHO, no case clusters have been reported and current evidence suggests H9N2 has n't acquired the ability for sustained transmission. Feb 3 AFD post";"EN";2019-02-04 07:00:00;"1 6";

Kuwait bans Indian poultry and eggs, lifts ban on Mexican chicken products 
KUWAIT: Kuwaiti authorities destroyed scores of birds yesterday at the pet market ( also known as the bird market ) in Rai to prevent the spread of bird flu. The birds were culled and placed in black garbage bags, which were then taken to an undisclosed location to be incinerated. `` All the birds here were slaughtered because of bird flu -- we wo n't take any chances, '' said a vet, who did not give his identity pending an official announcement. Asked if bird flu is dangerous and contagious to humans, he said so far there have been no transmissions of the virus to humans. `` The ministry of health will come up with a bulletin on the matter, '' the vet told Kuwait Times. 
All the shops were forcibly closed and customers were turned away as officials from the Public Authority for Agricultural Affairs and Fish Resources ( PAAAFR ) worked in cooperation with the environmental police and officers from the Municipality to eradicate infected and potentially infected birds. Trucks and police cars were on standby at the market. Avian influenza ( H5N1 ), informally known as bird flu, is a viral infection that can infect not only birds, but also humans and other animals. However, most forms of the virus are restricted to birds. 
Many shop owners were shocked to hear that their birds were being destroyed. A Bangladeshi shop attendant who had hundreds of birds at his shop, said it was very unfortunate that the birds that were not sick had to be killed. `` They had collected birds from many shops. One shop experienced it first, then I heard many birds fell ill and died the following day. This morning the Municipality came to check -- the next thing they were killing all the birds to prevent the spread of bird flu, '' he said. 
Kuwait last suffered a major outbreak of bird flu in 2007. On Feb 13, 2007, PAAAFR reported the initial outbreak of H5N1 in poultry in Wafra. Subsequently, 131 influenza virus infected poultry were confirmed from 20 farms throughout the country. The disease resulted in high mortality rates among infected flocks, especially in commercial broiler farms in Wafra and among poultry raised in privately owned residential homes and backyard farms. 

Disease control measures were implemented beginning Feb 18, 2007, including control of poultry movement, vaccination, disinfection of infected premises and culling of 500,000 birds. The final case of subtype H5N1 was detected on April 20, 2007, and all restrictions were lifted on May 12, 2007. Kuwait was declared free of highly pathogenic avian influenza on July 21, 2007. 
Meanwhile, the Public Authority for Food and Nutrition yesterday said that the ministry of commerce and industry has placed a ban on the import of all kinds of poultry meat ( fresh and frozen ) and their derivatives from India due to the outbreak of bird flu ( H5N1 ). The ministry decided to lift the ban on the import of all poultry meat ( fresh and frozen ) and their derivatives, including eggs, from Mexico, which was placed due to the outbreak of bird flu. The ministry also decided to lift the ban on the import of all types of meats ( fresh and frozen ) from Italy due to the end of the anthrax disease outbreak.

Today the Democratic Republic of the Congo's ( DRC's ) health ministry reported three more cases and two new deaths in an ongoing Ebola outbreak. The outbreak now stands at 788 cases, including 486 deaths, and 191 suspected cases are still under investigation. The new cases were reported in recent outbreak hotspots, including one each in Katwa, Kyondo and Oicha. The deaths occurred in Katwa and Kyondo, with the Kyondo fatality listed as a community death. So far, the virus has remained in DRC's North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Officials also said a total of 74,096 people have been vaccinated with the VSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by Merck.

Feb 5 DRC update Two more MERS infections reported in Saudi Arabia. 
Today Saudi Arabia's ministry of health ( MOH ) recorded two more MERS-CoV cases, both of which appear to be part of an ongoing outbreak in Wadi ad-Dawasir. The patients are men ages 42 and 41. The 42-year-old is listed as a secondary household contact, and the 41-year-old is a secondary healthcare contact. Both men are hospitalized for their MERS-CoV ( Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ) infections. Over the weekend, the MOH reported at least 5 cases of MERS in Wadi ad-Dawasir, and the country has seen 24 cases since the first of the year. The cases suggest a healthcare-associated outbreak. Along with camel transmission, healthcare-associated outbreaks are a hallmark of MERS-CoV. Yesterday, Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease blog, reported that agriculture officials in Oman have tested local camels for MERS-CoV, and the animals are negative for the virus. The testing was prompted by 5 recent cases of MERS in Oman, including 2 deaths. Oman has now reported 19 MERS-CoV infections since 2013. Feb 5 MOH report.

The patients are two boys who are younger than 2 years old and a woman between ages 25 and 35. All live in the northwestern part of Harris County. Umair Shah, MD, MPH, executive director at HCPH, said measles is highly contagious and spreads to others through coughing and sneezing. `` However, it is easily preventable. Parents and caregivers have the power to protect their children and themselves from this disease by getting vaccinated, '' he said. Also, the Galveston County Health District ( GCHD ) yesterday reported one case involving a boy ages 12 to 24 months who was tested Jan 28 and is part of a measles cluster in the region.

All but two of the 49 confirmed cases are children age 18 or younger, and 42 patients were unimmunized, 6 have an unverified immunization status, and 1 had received the measles, mumps, and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine. Earlier in the outbreak, 2 confirmed cases linked to the outbreak were reported, one from neighboring Multnomah County in Oregon and one Seattle-King County. No new cases have been reported from those two locations. The CCPH said its cases include two people who traveled to Hawaii, one who traveled to Bend, Ore., and two who moved to Georgia. Feb 4 CCPH update Bat Zika virus study finds possible animal model and ecological role. 
Jamaican fruit bats -- one of the most common bat species in the Caribbean region, Central America, and Mexico -- may be a useful animal model for studying Zika virus and may play a role in virus ecology, according to experiments conducted by researchers from Colorado State University. Their two-part study was designed to gauge the susceptibility of the bats to Zika infection and to follow the disease course with tests to assess viremia, tissue tropism, replication, and shedding. The team reported their findings yesterday in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. They noted that experiments in the 1950s and 1960s showed that several bat species were naturally and experimentally susceptible to Zika virus, with some developing neurological disease. In the new experiments, Jamaican fruit bats infected in the lab mounted an antibody response. In some of the bats during 28-day follow up, researchers found evidence of viral replication and pathologic findings in the brain, testes, lungs, and salivary glands. They did n't find any blood brain barrier disruption and raised the possibility that microglial cells might be the Zika virus entry route to bat brains. They concluded that bats might be a suitable animal model for studying Zika pathogenesis, including the assessment of sexual transmission, in-utero transmission, birth defects, and neurologic derangements. They also note that Zika could be a wildlife disease that affects bat populations, and more study is needed to fully understand the role bats might play in maintaining the virus.

Thursday 07 February 2019 

The UAE has banned the import of all birds and poultry from Kuwait after the outbreak of a highly contagious strain of bird flu ( H5N8 ) in the GCC state. 
The UAE's ministry of Climate Change and Environment ( MOCCAE ) confirmed on Thursday that the decision was based on a notification from the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases. 
All species of domestic and wild live birds, ornamental birds, chicks, hatching and table eggs, poultry meat, and their non-heat-treated by-products and waste from Kuwait have been banned until the outbreak is brought under control, the ministry said. 
However, thermally-treated poultry products ( meat and eggs ) have been cleared for import from Kuwait. 
Sheikh Dr Majid Sultan Al Qassimi, director of Animal Health and Development Department at MOCCAE, said: `` Through taking immediate precautionary measures to curb any strains of the bird flu virus that has affected Kuwait from reaching the UAE, MOCCAE hopes to ensure bio-security levels and prevent the spread of pathogens in the country. 
`` We are confident such efforts will mitigate the impact of the bird flu on the UAE's poultry health and safety, in addition to protecting public health and well-being. '' 
The ministry is carefully scrutinising documentation accompanying consignments ( certificate of origin, health certificate and halal certifications, among others ) of food products shipped into the country, it said. 
It is also conducting sensory detection to ensure that the quality of the products -- as per their identification cards -- complies with the UAE's stringent standards. 
Samples of food products from shipments are transferred to laboratories for the necessary tests to ensure they are safe and fit to enter the country. 
According to the latest report from the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ), a total of 68 countries worldwide have been affected by avian influenza in domestic birds between January 2013 and August 2018. In total, 7,122 outbreaks have been reported in domestic birds during the period. 
Earlier this year, the UAE also banned the import of poultry, meat and live birds from parts of Russia, following the outbreak of the H5N2 strain of bird flu in the country.

The great worldwide flu pandemic of 1918 killed 50 million people and reduced average life expectancy in the U.S. alone by an astonishing 12 percent. 
Today, the medical community lives in fear that it could happen again. 
Bird flu is especially concerning, as those strains of the disease can build up in wild bird populations, jump to chickens and then to humans. Humans are particularly susceptible to those flu strains. 
What if we could break the chain? 
British scientists are on it, developing chickens that are resistant to flu. 
Gene-editing techniques can knock out a protein in chicken DNA that flu needs to develop. People might still encounter wild birds but the `` flu bridge '' between wild birds and people would be gone. 
The evidence is mounting in favor of biotechnology as one of the most important developments in human history -- in medicine and in food.";"EN";2019-02-08 12:37:50;"1 6";

BOKARO/RANCHI: The state animal husbandry department on Saturday confirmed that the mysterious death of crows and poultry in Gomia block of Bokaro and Mehrama block in Godda were due to avian flu. The department had on January 28 sent samples to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases ( NIHSD ), Bhopal, which said the tests confirmed the same, Dr Vijay Singh, director of the animal husbandry department, said. 

Singh said: `` In Gomia, bird flu has affected crows, while in Godda, the tests were positive for crows as well as poultry chicken. We have asked the administration to keep a vigil on the situation. '' 

The mysterious death of crows has become a major cause of concern for residents of Gomia, where rotting carcasses of these birds have become a common sight. 

District animal husbandry officer Arun Kumar Sinha said: `` We have now collected swabs of poultry and sent them for tests to confirm if bird flu has affected chicken. It is safe to consume eggs and chicken because they are cooked at very high temperatures. There is no need for panic. '' He said response teams led by veterinary doctors have been constituted in each block. 

State health, family welfare and medical education department has issued directives to all the district hospitals to screen people if they show any symptoms of swine flu. The surveillance officers at all the districts have been directed to collect samples for test. Viral Transport Media ( VTM ) kits have been available at all state-run medical colleges, including RIMS, MGMCH Jamshedpur and PMCH Dhanbad to ensure that patients can be tested within 24 - 48 hours of suspected infection. An advertisement has been issued for publication in all dailies so that people can be made aware about the disease. 

Speaking to TOI, state surveillance officer of integrated disease surveillance program ( IDSP ) Rakesh Dayal said: `` We have alerted all the district hospitals to maintain buffer stock of medicine and VTM kits have been supplied to them. We have also set up isolation wards at all the medical colleges and have directed the district surveillance officers to contact medical colleges in case of any detection.

The authorities in Bokaro are rushing quick response teams to nine blocks in the district in the wake of bird flu confirmation in Gomia. The state animal husbandry department had on Saturday said samples of dead crows sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases ( NIHSAD ), Bhopal, had tested positive for the H5N1 virus that is responsible for the highly infectious scourge in avian species. Besides Gomia, where crows began dropping dead in the last week of January, Bermo, Chandrapura, Kasmar, Chas, Nawadih, Chandankyari, Jaridih and Petarwar blocks have been put on high alert, said Bokaro animal husbandry officer Arun Kumar Sinha. `` We have sent special teams to these areas. But, there is no need to panic, as bird flu has not been reported in poultry yet. No poultry death has taken place so far. Besides, we have sent poultry samples to the Bhopal lab as a precautionary measure, '' he said, adding that reports were expected in a couple of days. The animal husbandry officer nonetheless advised poultry farmers to isolate and cull sick birds, restrict access to healthy ones, clean cages and equipment regularly, disinfect footwear/gloves of workers and stop borrowing supplies from other farms. `` People who eat chicken and eggs need not worry. Boiling these above 70 ° C kills the H5N1 virus. Also, to avoid human infection in case of an outbreak, one must avoid domesticating poultry birds, '' Sinha said. The nine quick response teams, the officer said, would aid in containing the spread of bird flu. `` If need be, more than one team can be rushed to a particular block or area to assist in culling. Each team is lead by a veterinarian who will supervise culling, disposal of carcasses, vaccination and disinfecting poultry farms, '' he said. On how the crows contracted the deadly H5N1 virus, Sinha said it was possible that some migratory avian species were the carriers. `` This winter, several migratory birds were seen in and around Bokaro, including Gomia. It is possible they are responsible for the spread of avian influenza in crows. ''";"EN";2019-02-10 20:42:00;"1 6";

United Arab Emirates suspends poultry imports from Kuwait due to bird flu11 February 2019 Birds and poultry from KUWAIT are prohibited from entering the UAEAccording to reporting by Gulf Business, the UAE has banned birds and poultry from Kuwait due to a H5N8 outbreak on Kuwaiti poultry farms. 
The ban will be enforced based on a notification by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations ' ( FAO ) Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases, according to UAE's Ministry of Climate Change and Environment ( MOCCAE ). 
The products banned include all species of domestic and wild live birds, ornamental birds, chicks, hatching and table eggs, poultry meat, non-heat-treated by-products and waste from Kuwait. Thermally-treated poultry products for both meat and eggs are the exceptions, which would be allowed into the UAE. 

`` Through making immediate precautionary measures to cur any strains of the bird flu virus that has affected the UAE, MOCCAE hopes to ensure bio-security levels and prevent the spread of pathogens in the country, '' said Sheik Majid Sultan al Qassimi, director of the Animal Health and Development Department at MOCCAE. 
`` We are confident such efforts will mitigate the impact of the bird flu on the UAE's poultry health and safety, in addition to protecting public health and well-being. '' 
As part of efforts to control food imports in relation to the ban, documentation for consignments of food products entering the UAE would be placed under strict inspection. Sensory detection will also be conducted to check project quality and ensure they comply with the UAE's standards. 
In addition, samples from these shipments would be tested at laboratories in the country. 
This year, the UAE also blocked the import of poultry and live birds from parts of Russia, following an outbreak of H2N5 bird-flu in the country.";"EN";2019-02-11 11:16:21;"1 6";

WINDHOEK, Feb. 13 ( Xinhua ) -- Namibia's Agriculture Ministry on Wednesday announced and confirmed the first outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza ( H5N8 ) in the African country. 
The ministry said in a statement that the disease was detected in penguins on Halifax Island near Luderitz in the Karas region in the southern parts of the country on Feb. 2. More than 200 penguins have been reported dead so far from an estimated population of about 7,000. 
`` No other birds on the island seem to be affected by this disease at the moment. The penguins were burnt and buried on the island and so far no cases of domestic birds have been reported, '' it added. 
According to the ministry, all birds are thought to be susceptible to infection with bird flu, though some species are more resistant to infection than others. 
H5N8 is a subtype of the bird flu virus. Although it is considered one of the less pathogenic subtypes for humans, the ministry warned that other strains like H5N1 and H7N9 may be transmitted to people. 
Farmers and the general public in Namibia are asked to immediately report any suspicion of avian influenza to the nearest state veterinary office, as vaccination and treatment of sick birds against the pathogen are prohibited in the country.";"EN";2019-02-13 08:00:00;"1 6";

Researchers are unsure why human cases of the bird flu virus H5N1 gradually subsided amid fears of a human pandemic in 2007, reports STAT. 
Four things to know: 
1. H5N1 spread through Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, killing large amounts of poultry and 6 in 10 humans who contracted the disease. 
2. Concerned about an H5N1 pandemic, health officials created emergency plans, stockpiled antiviral medications and worked on experimental vaccines against the bird flu virus. However, the number of human H5N1 cases waned on its own, and the last known H5N1 infection in a human occurred in February 2017. 
3. Health experts do not know why the virus has faded over time but warn this trend could change. 
`` We do n't know how the story going to end, '' Nancy Cox, PhD, a virologist who served as the director of the CDC's influenza division from 2006 - 14, told STAT. 
4. Experts say the virus could mutate into different iterations that prove more infectious to humans. 
`` The H5N1 virus has not gone away. It's just changed into different versions of itself, '' flu expert Dr. Malik Peiris, a professor of virology at the University of Hong Kong, told STAT. `` So now we have two high pathogenic [ H5 ] viruses kicking around. ''

JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA ( ADV ) -- The Namibian government has announced that it was alert amid an outbreak of avian influenza, also known as avian flu. 
Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry acting chief veterinary officer, Albertina Shilongo, told The Namibian that the disease has been detected in penguins at Halifax Island near Lüderitz in the Kharas region recently. 
`` When you vaccinate these chickens, you will not get rid of the virus. But if you do not vaccinate them, you will be able to contain the outbreak, '' said Shilongo. 
She noted that this was the first time that the country experiences this outbreak. Currently, over 200 penguins of the 7000 population have died from the disease. 
The disease was discovered after a team from the marine life awareness group arrived the Halifax Island, and counted 184 dead penguins last month. 
Avian influenza refers to the disease caused by infection with avian ( bird ) influenza ( flu ) Type A viruses. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Avian flu viruses do not normally infect humans. 
Avian Flu symptoms include sudden death without any signs; lack of coordination; purple discolouration of the wattles, combs, and legs; soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; lack of energy and appetite; diarrhoea; swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles and hocks; and nasal discharge.

THE fisheries ministry yesterday announced an outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza ( H5N8 ) at Halifax island, close to Luderitz. 
According to the Acting Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Albertina Shilongo, the outbreak is a first for Namibia and was detected in penguins last week. Over 200 were killed from a population of 7000 penguins. 
`` No other birds on the island are affected at the moment. The dead penguins were burnt and buried at the island. H5N8 is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A of the influenza virus which occurs worldwide. All birds are susceptible to the disease although some species are more resistant. The disease is characterised by severe illness, rapid death with a mortality rate that can approach 100 %, '' Dr. Shilongo warned. 
She added that common symptoms include swelling and purple discoloration of the head, comb and wattle, swelling and red discoloration of the feet, bleeding of internal organs and muscles, diarrhea, twisting of the neck, staggering movement and paralysis of wings and legs. 
Dr. Shilongo further cautioned that wild birds play a role in the spread of the disease. Domestic birds like chickens can be infected if close contact is made. She said that although the Avian influenza sub type is not known to infect humans, other strains like H5N1, H7N9 may be transmitted to humans. 
Humans can be infected via the eyes, nose and mouth while handling and coming into close contact with infected poultry. She added that handling and consuming infected products is dangerous for humans.";"EN";2019-02-14 14:28:00;"1 6";

STAT: What happened to bird flu? How a major threat to human health faded from view 
`` Just over a dozen years ago, a bird flu virus known as H5N1 was charting a destructive course through Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East, ravaging poultry in apocalyptic numbers and killing six in 10 humans known to have contracted it. The overall human death toll was low -- in the hundreds -- but scientists and government officials feared that the virus could ignite a human pandemic reminiscent of the catastrophic 1918 Spanish flu. Emergency plans were drafted, experimental H5N1 vaccines were created and tested, antiviral drugs were stockpiled. And then ... nothing happened. The virus continued to kill chickens and to occasionally infect and sometimes kill people. But as the years passed, the number of human H5N1 cases subsided. There has not been a single H5N1 human infection detected since February 2017. This is the good news. The bad news is that the situation could change in an instant ...

A total of eight Rapid Response Teams ( RRT ) having 10 members each started the process of culling of birds in Mehrma block of Godda district on Thursday after positive readings of Avian Influenza ( AI ) in the area. 
Director, Animal Husbandry, Chitaranjan Kumar said, `` We had sent samples from each district for confirmation of bird flu ( H5N1 ) of which the one from Fajilkhutahari village of Godda came in positive. 
A team from the centre has arrived at the district to conduct surveillance and take necessary steps. Action is being taken by the district administration as prescribed under the Government of India's action plan, 2015. '' 
The samples were sent to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases ( NIHSAD ), Bhopal which confirmed AI in Fajilkhutahari village of Godda. Following this a directive was issued to the Chief Secretary of Jharkhand by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare to carry out control and containment operations as per the action plan of animal husbandry for preparedness, control and containment of avian influenza, 2015. The various steps to be taken includes declaration of infected and surveillance areas, restricting access to the infected premises, destruction of birds, disposal of dead birds and infected materials, clean-up and disinfection followed by sealing of the premises and issue of sanitization certificate and others. 
Based on the guidelines of the action plan, district administration has notified the names of all such villages within one kilometre radius of the site confirmed of AI as infected zone while the area from one kilometre to 10 kilometre radius has been notified as surveillance zone. 
Sub divisional officer ( SDO ) of Mahagama, Banka Ram, informed that seven villages have been identified as infected zones including Falilkhutahari, Meghachasar, Shobhapur, Tarkurwa, Bhalu, Barari and Sukhari. 
`` Meghachasar is the biggest commercial area with a huge number of non-vegetarian items being sold here so the culling of birds started here, '' he said. Ram informed that the shopkeepers were paid Rs 70 per unit for chicken, Rs 130 per unit for duck and Rs 3 per egg before the birds were destroyed. 
Meanwhile, the health department released an awareness advertisement regarding both AI and Swine Flu on Thursday, which will be out in newspapers on Friday. 
`` The awareness message informs citizens about the symptoms of both bird flu and swine flu and dos and do n'ts, '' said Dr. Rakesh Dayal, State Surveillance Officer, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme ( IDSP ). 
Dayal informed that people need not worry about the disease as not a single case of AI has been detected in human. `` The cases have only been detected in birds and transmission from birds to human is extremely rare, '' he said. 
He further informed that health screening of villagers in the affected village has already been done and no suspected case has been found. `` People have been directed not to handle dead birds if they come across one to avoid getting infected, '' Dayal said. 
In another instance, AI was also found in a crow sample sent from Gomiya block of Bokaro. Bokaro Deputy Commissioner, Shailesh Chaurasia said, `` While AI was confirmed in crows, we sent a chicken sample as well and the reports for that came out negative so there is nothing to worry about. Had the chicken sample been positive, we would have issued an alert. ''";"EN";2019-02-14 17:35:03;"1 6";

New health area, Bunia, reports Ebola in DRC as outbreak hits 829 cases. 
Bunia, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) is the 19th health district to confirm an Ebola case, the DRC's ministry of health said today in its daily update. The case in Bunia is in a 6-month-old baby whose mother died from the virus. The mother was from Katwa, and her corpse was intercepted in Komanda, where the baby is currently being treated in an Ebola treatment center. The baby is among 6 new cases reported today, which also include 3 in Katwa, and 2 in Butembo. The cases raise the outbreak total to 829, of which 786 cases are confirmed and 61 are probable. A total of 201 cases are still under investigation, which is up from 177 yesterday. Four new fatalities recorded today raise the death toll in the outbreak to 521. Among the new deaths are 3 community deaths in Katwa and Butembo, the current disease hot spots. The ministry of health said 79,146 people have been vaccinated against the virus with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, including 20,547 in Beni, 19,971 in Katwa, and 9,214 in Butembo. Feb 14 DRC update Oman report 4 new MERS infections, Saudi Arabia 1Several Arabic media outlets are reporting that the Omani ministry of health has confirmed 4 more MERS cases in Oman, while Saudi Arabia also noted a new, fatal case. The Omani cases are part of an ongoing outbreak and bring the total to 10 recent cases of MERS-CoV ( Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ) in that country, which had not seen the a MERS case since March 2018. According to Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease tracking blog, the Omani ministry of health said the 10 cases have resulted in 4 deaths in different provinces. If confirmed, that would mean the outbreak is no longer contained to a single family farm, as reported by the World Health Organization on Feb 11. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health ( MOH ), meanwhile, today recorded another new MERS-CoV case for epidemiologic week 7 in Wadi ad-Dawasir. The infection lifts the country's MERS-CoV cases since the first of the year to 61, which includes 38 from Wadi ad-Dawasir, the site of a possible hospital-based outbreak. The patient is a 60-year-old man who died after acquiring MERS in a healthcare setting. He did not have camel contact, a known risk factor, the Saudi MOH said. Feb 14 Avian Flu Diary post Study: 1 to 4 meningitis B outbreaks on US college campuses annually. 
According to a study yesterday in Emerging Infectious Diseases, from 2013 to 2017 officials confirmed one to four meningococcal serogroup B outbreaks on American college campuses annually, which suggests that wider use of the MenB vaccine could be used in outbreak and non-outbreak settings. Since 2005, most American college students have been vaccinated with the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine covering serogroups A, C, W, and Y ( MenACWY ), but serotype B has now become the most prevalent on college campuses. In 2013, MenB became available for outbreak response, and, by 2015, MenB vaccines were available for wider use, though not routinely administered. From January 2013 to May 2018, there were 10 university-based meningococcal disease outbreaks caused by serogroup B reported in seven states, which resulted in 39 cases and 2 deaths ( 5 % case-fatality rate ). `` Only 1 case occurred in a student who previously received MenB vaccine; this student had been vaccinated with 1 dose of MenB vaccine 6 days before disease onset, '' the study authors, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said. `` The remaining cases occurred in persons believed to be unvaccinated with MenB vaccine. `` In all but two outbreaks, mass vaccination campaigns with MenB were put in place across campus, and the vaccine was also offered at campus health centers, by appointment, and during seasonal flu vaccinations. Still, MenB vaccination coverage in response to university-based outbreaks was highly variable, ranging from an estimated 14 % to 98 % for the first dose ( median, 67 % ), the study authors said. `` Coverage with > 1 dose of MenB vaccine among persons 17 years of age was estimated to be 14.5 % in 2017 ( 13 ), and a recent survey demonstrated that only 2 % of universities require MenB vaccination for student, '' the authors concluded. `` Achieving high MenB vaccination coverage is necessary to help protect persons during outbreaks of meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B.

HANOI, Feb. 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has unveiled a national plan on bird flu prevention and control for the 2019 - 2025 period, Vietnam News Agency reported on Thursday. 
The plan seeks to prevent and control bird flu outbreaks and help form disease-free poultry farming zones and chains, thus minimizing the disease's impact on Vietnam's public health, food safety, and trading activities. 
Authorized forces are requested to control outbreaks through early detection and a swift dealing with infected hotbeds to prevent them from spreading. The plan also tasks them with preventing new and dangerous flu strains from entering or spreading in Vietnam, while vaccinating at least 80 percent of poultry. 
Vietnam's northern Quang Ninh province has recently detected three outbreaks of H5N6 bird flu outbreaks which have affected thousands of fowls, the provincial animal health bureau said last month. 
Meanwhile, an H5N1 bird flu outbreak has happened in southern Long An province, hitting fowls in a commune, the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said in January. 
In Vietnam, bird flu virus H5N1 in poultry was reported for the first time in late 2003. More than 45 million poultry were culled between 2003 and 2006. Since then, hundreds of thousands of fowls have been killed each year. 
In the 2004 - 2014 period, 127 people in Vietnam were infected with H5N1, including 64 fatalities, according to its Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

HÀ NỘI -- Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc has signed off on a national plan on avian influenza prevention and control for 2019 - 25 with a view to reducing its impact on society and the economy. 

The plan seeks to prevent and control avian influenza outbreaks and help form disease-free poultry farming zones and chains, thus minimising bird flu's impact on Việt Nam's public health, food safety, and trading activities. 

Authorised forces are requested to control outbreaks through early detection and swift action on infected animals to prevent the disease from spreading. The plan also tasked them with preventing new and dangerous flu strains from entering or spreading in Việt Nam, while vaccinating at least 80 per cent of poultry subject to vaccination. 

Additionally, disease-free poultry production zones and chains need to be created in conformity with recommendations of the World Organisation of Animal Health, thus ensuring qualified supply for domestic consumption and export, and reducing the human infection of dangerous flu strains like the H5 or H7 viruses, according to the plan. 

In Việt Nam, avian influenza virus A/H5N1 in poultry was reported for the first time in late 2003. At that time, Việt Nam was one of the first countries to declare an epidemic of this virus and suffered heavy losses when more than 45 million poultry were culled between 2003 and 2006. Since then, hundreds of thousands of poultry have been killed each year. 

From 2004 to 2014, 127 people were infected with A/H5N1, including 64 victims who did not survive, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. -- VNS";"EN";2019-02-15 07:00:00;"1 6";

WALVIS BAY - The Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources says samples collected from hundreds of dead penguins tested by the Central Veterinary Laboratory tested positive for Avian Influenza H5N8, a type of bird flu. 
This follows after about 250 dead penguins were discovered late December on Halifax Island situated about 10 kilometres from Luderitz. 
According to a press statement issued by the public relations officer of the ministry, De Wet Siluka, this specific strain of bird flu normally occurs naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other birds or animal species as well. However, it does not normally infect humans. 
Siluka said the ministry of fisheries has already taken precautionary measures and will continue to contain the infection to prevent further spreading. 
`` Such measures include regular visits to collect dead carcasses, isolating the sick birds and disinfecting wet areas around the colonies, and chemicals as the virus can not survive in salt water, '' he assured members of the public. 
The infected birds will not usually get sick but can spread the contagious virus that can even kill certain domestic bird species including chickens and turkeys. 
`` Infected birds shed the virus through their saliva, nasal secretion and faeces. Healthy birds can contract the virus by coming in contact with contaminated services. However the good thing is that the virus can not survive in salt water, '' he said. 
Halifax is situated about 10 kilometres west of Luderitz and is located about 100 metres off the mainland. It is the third most important breeding site for African penguins and home to about 2500 that contribute to the entire Namibian population of 26000 penguins. Other seabirds such as the crowned cormorants, swift terns and Hartlaub's gulls also breed on this island. Senior fisheries biologist, Desmond Tom, told New Era yesterday that humans are not at risk, however they can spread the virus to other animals if they get into contact with infected animals. 
`` The good thing however is that the island is currently non-accessible to people apart from fisheries officials, '' he said.

THE ministry of agriculture on Wednesday morning issued a notice warning farmers about an outbreak of the highly pathogenic Avian Influenza affecting birds in Namibia. Avian Influenza, also known as Avian flu, is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A strains, which occurs worldwide, although some species are more resistant than others. The ministry's acting chief veterinary officer Albertina Shilongo said that the disease was detected in penguins in the Halifax Island near! Naminus at Lüderitz in the / / Kharas region on 2 February 2019. Shilongo said over 200 penguins have been reported dead so far from an estimated population of about 7000 penguins, although no cases in domestic birds have been detected. Symptoms of the disease include swelling and purple discoloration of the head, comb and wattle, swelling and red discoloration of the feet, bleeding of internal organs and muscles, greenish diarrhoea, twisting of the neck, staggering movement and paralysis of wings and legs. Shilongo also said that wild birds play a major role in the maintenance and spread of the virus. She urged farmers to take preventative measures, including reporting any suspicion of Avian Influenza in domestic or wild birds to the nearest state veterinary office. Farmers are also urged to keep poultry away from areas frequented by wild birds and to keep away elements that may attract wild birds, including poultry feed products placed outside the building. Shilongo also adviced farmers to avoid the introduction of birds of unknown disease status into the flock, ensure appropriate disposal of manure, litter and dead poultry.";"EN";2019-02-15 12:09:13;"1 6";

The ministry's acting chief veterinary officer, Albertina Shilongo, said the disease was detected in penguins at Halifax Island near Lüderitz in the / / Kharas region on 2 February 2019. Shilongo said this was the first avian flu outbreak in Namibia. Over 200 penguins have been reported dead so far from an estimated population of 7000, although no cases in domestic birds have been detected. The Lüderitz marine research group, an awareness group that shares information about marine life, posted photographs of the dead penguins on the internet after discovering a sudden increase in mortalities among the birds at Halifax Island beach. The disease was discovered after a team from the marine life awareness group managed to get onto Halifax Island, and counted 184 dead penguins on 17 January. The Namibian recently reported that the team brought back four sick penguins, as well as samples taken from 12 birds. Symptoms of the disease include swelling and purple discolouration of the head, comb and wattle, swelling and red discolouration of the feet, bleeding of internal organs and muscles, greenish diarrhoea, twisting of the neck, staggering movements and paralysis of wings and legs. Shilongo said wild birds play a major role in the maintenance and spread of the virus. She thus urged farmers to take preventative measures, including reporting any suspicions of an avian flu outbreak among domestic or wild birds to the nearest state veterinary office. Farmers are also urged to keep poultry away from areas frequented by wild birds, and to keep away elements that may attract wild birds, including poultry feed placed outside a building. Shilongo also advised farmers to avoid introducing birds of unknown health status to their flocks, and to ensure the appropriate disposal of manure, litter and dead poultry. The ministry's spokesperson, Margaret Kalo, said unlike the Newcastle disease that can be vaccinated against, avian influenza vaccination is not allowed in Namibia. `` When you vaccinate these chickens, you will not get rid of the virus. But if you do not vaccinate them, you will be able to contain the outbreak, '' she explained.";"EN";2019-02-15 13:39:04;"1 6";

Taipei, Feb. 18 ( CNA ) More than 32,500 free-range chickens on a farm in Changhua County have been culled after the farm was confirmed to be infected with the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus, an official from the county's Animal Disease Control Center ( ADCC ) said Monday. ADCC Director Tung Meng-chih ( 董孟治 ) said the birds were exterminated and disinfectant work carried out at the farm after the test results came back a day earlier. Suspicion of an avian influenza outbreak arose after 340 chickens on the farm died within a relatively short space of time. In wake of the latest cull, Tung reminded farmers that if they discover their poultry showing symptoms such as swollen faces, bleeding from the eyes and nostrils, and other signs of disease to proactively contact their local animal disease control centers. According to statistics provided by the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine ( BAPHIQ ), four other poultry farms across the country have been affected by the H5N2 avian influenza virus so far this year, including two chicken farms and one duck farm in Yunlin County, and one duck farm in Pingtung County.BAPHIQ statistics also show that a total of 93 poultry farms were hit by H5N2 in 2018.

TAIPEI ( Taiwan News ) -- An outbreak of the avian influenza virus ( bird flu ) has been reported in a farm in western Taiwan's Changhua County, with more than 340 chickens found dead from the disease and over 32,500 culled, announced the Animal Disease Control Center ( ADCC ) yesterday ( Feb. 18 ). 
ADCC Director Tung Meng-chih ( 董孟治 ) told the media yesterday that a farm located in Changhua County's Dacheng Township notified the Changhua County Animal Disease Control Center on Feb. 13 that there were 340 sudden, successive deaths by its chickens, and they suspected that avian influenza could be the culprit. When inspectors arrived on the scene, they cordoned off the area and took samples of the farm's free-range chickens. 
Tung said that test results came on Sunday ( Feb. 17 ) which confirmed that the farm's chickens had contracted the H5N2 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Staff from the Changhua County Animal Disease Control Center rushed in to cull 32,500 free-range chickens on the firm and disinfected the area to prevent the spread of the virus. 
Tung stressed that the H5N2 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza has long been localized in Taiwan and coupled with the arrival of migratory birds during the winter, the opportunities for spreading the virus have been increased. 
Tung said that if a poultry farm notices that their livestock are displaying suspicious symptoms, such as facial swelling, bleeding from the eyes and beak, lack of appetite, diarrhea, breathing problems, and sudden deaths, the livestock owner should notify the township and municipal public office or Animal Disease Control Center.";"EN";2019-02-19 02:58:00;"1 6";

An outbreak of bird flu also known as Avian Influenza has hit Plateau, killing at least 3,900 birds. 
The Chief Veterinary Officer of the State, Dr. Spak Shaset, told the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday in Jos that the outbreak has affected two farms in Jos North and Jos South Local Government Areas of the state. 
`` Sometimes in January, when we heard of an outbreak of the dreaded disease in some part of Bauchi state, we knew Plateau is at risk. 

`` I immediately summoned our divisional health officers in the 17 councils, and in less than 72 hours after we met, report got to us of suspected cases in some farms in the state. 
`` We immediately swung into action and took sample from the farms to our labs and it was confirmed it is bird flu. 
`` Without hesitation, we went and depopulated the farms to avoid further spread of the disease to other farms. 
`` More than 3,900 birds were destroyed; 2,900 from the farm in Jos South and 1,000 in the farm in Jos North, '' he said. 
Shaset said the two farms were decontaminated, disinfected and quarantined to avoid further spread to nearby farms and have other poultry farmers incur loses. 
The official said the government had taken positive and stringent steps to avert the further spread of the disease to other areas of the state, which if left unattended to, could also transmit into human beings, which according to him, could be very disastrous. 
Shaset charged poultry farmers and live bird marketers to step up bio-security and hygiene measures within and around their farms and markets. 
He advised Plateau residents to avoid the sale, slaughtering and consumption of sick and dead birds to avoid being infected.

WHO: Brisk flu activity reported in several countries. 
Flu is rising in several parts of the world, with 2009 H1N1 dominant, but many locations experiencing H3N2 circulation, as well, the World Health Organization ( WHO ) said yesterday in a global flu update, covering activity through Feb 3. In Europe, most countries have passed their epidemic thresholds, with high-intensity activity reported in the southwestern regions and hospitalization rates high in France and the United Kingdom. Levels of severe acute respiratory infections are on the rise in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Flu detections are rising in North Africa, and in the Mediterranean region, flu levels are increasing in Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, and Lebanon. In East Asia, flu levels are still high in China and Hong Kong, but activity is declining in Japan and South Korea. In South Asia, flu activity remained elevated, with levels increasing in India, mainly from 2009 H1N1, and flu activity continues but is mixed in Southeast Asia, with virus levels on the rise in the Philippines. Flu levels were low in most tropical Americas and African locations, as well as in most of the Southern Hemisphere, except for parts of Australia, where flu activity is above inter-seasonal levels. At the global level, 98.2 % of specimens positive for flu in the latter half of January and into the first few days of February were influenza A. Of subtyped influenza A strains, 72 % were 2009 H1N1 and 28 % were H3N2. Feb 18 WHO global flu update More high-path H5 avian flu outbreaks noted in India, Nigeria, South Africa. 
India has reported another highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu outbreak, and two African countries reported more H5N8 outbreaks, according to the latest notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). In India, the outbreak involves backyard poultry in Jharkhand state in the far eastern part of the country. The outbreak began on Jan 25, killing 26 of 6,000 susceptible birds. Authorities culled 4,439 birds as part of response efforts. India has recently reported a few other outbreaks in wild birds and poultry in Orissa and Bihar states in eastern India, as well as in peacocks at a zoo in Bihar. Elsewhere, Nigeria's agriculture ministry reported two outbreaks involving highly pathogenic H5N8 on commercial poultry farms in Plateau state in the central part of the country. The outbreaks began on Feb 7 and Feb 11, and taken together, the virus killed 71 of 3,940 birds at the locations, one of which housed 52-week-old layers and the other having 10-week-old pullets and 6-week-old broilers. The remaining birds were destroyed to curb the spread of the virus. Nigeria's last H5N8 outbreak occurred in early January on a poultry farm in Bauchi state. In another H5N8 development, South Africa reported two more outbreaks at commercial ostrich farms, both in Western Cape province in the south of the country. The events began on Dec 7 and Jan 8, and between the pair of outbreaks, the virus killed 174 of 6,059 ostriches. Stamping out and destroying the animal products were to be applied as part of control measures. The latest detections are part of ongoing sporadic H5N8 activity at South African ostrich farms.

An outbreak of bird flu, also known as avian influenza, has hit Plateau State, killing at least 3,900 birds. 
The Chief Veterinary Officer of the state, Dr Spak Shaset, told the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday in Jos, that the outbreak had affected two farms in the Jos North and Jos South Local Government Areas of the state. 
He said, `` Sometimes in January, when we heard of an outbreak of the dreaded disease in some part of Bauchi State, we knew Plateau is at risk. 

`` I immediately summoned our divisional health officers in the 17 local government councils, and in less than 72 hours after we met, report got to us of suspected cases in some farms in the state. 
`` We immediately swung into action and took sample from the farms to our labs and it was confirmed it is bird flu. 
`` Without hesitation, we went and depopulated the farms to avoid further spread of the disease to other farms. 
`` More than 3,900 birds were destroyed; 2,900 from the farm in Jos South and 1,000 in the farm in Jos North. '' 
Shaset said the two farms were disinfected and quarantined to avoid further spread to nearby farms so that other poultry farmers would not incur losses. 
The official said the government had taken steps to avert further spread of the disease to other areas of the state, which if left unattended to, could also transmit into human beings, which according to him, could be very disastrous. 
Shaset charged poultry farmers and live bird marketers to step up bio-security and hygiene measures within and around their farms and markets.

Durban - Increased chicken imports from overseas are hitting the local poultry industry hard. In a statement, the South African Poultry Association said there were 538434 tonnes of chicken imported. 
Izaak Breitenbach, General manager of the Broiler division of SAPA said there was a dip in imports due to avian flu in Europe, but the shortfall was picked up by Brazil. 

`` A table produced by SAPA shows that total frozen broiler imports rose from 368201 tons in 2015 to 538434 tons in 2018. The value of all poultry imports in 2018, including MDM, is R6 billion. Frozen chicken portions -- the imports including the popular bone-in portions that have harmed local producers and killed South African jobs -- went up from 221218 tons in 2014 to 383297 tons last year, '' Breitenbach said. 
He said the increase in imported chickens was getting worse and would result in job losses. Breitenbach said, the imports demonstrated that there was a need for government to step in to help the industry. `` We are an efficient industry, but we can not compete against imports dumped below the cost of production, or from countries with a long history of agricultural subsidies, '' he said. 
The Daily News has previously reported that local chicken industry was hit hard by imports with Rainbow chickens having to close many of its farms which resulted in thousands of people losing their jobs.";"EN";2019-02-20 09:37:00;"1 6";

Bird flu, or avian flu, is an infection type of flu that usually spreads among birds, according to the NHS. But, on rare occasions, the virus can also infect humans, leading to some deadly symptoms and complications. No humans have ever become infected with any of the most common types of bird flu in the UK. But, Public Health England ( PHE ) has issued a warning for travellers after a new bird flu virus strain has been reported in humans for the first time.A case of H7N4 bird flu has been reported in a human for the first time, it's been revealed.A 68-year-old woman was admitted to hospital in China after developing symptoms, before the diagnosis was confirmed. She had been in contact with live poultry before her symptoms first appeared, according to the Hong Kong Department of Health. The H7N4 virus was confirmed for the first time between February 10 and 14, it added. `` Based on the seasonal pattern, the activity of avian influenza viruses is expected to be higher in winter, '' said a spokesman for The Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong. `` Travellers to the [ Chinese ] mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. `` They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. `` They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry. '' All UK travellers to China should speak to a doctor straight away if they develop any bird flu symptoms, urged PHE. The most common warning signs to look out for include a high fever, of over 38 degrees Celsius, difficulty breathing, and a bad cough. It's unlikely your symptoms are caused by bird flu unless you visited live bird or animal markets while in China, or touched any dying birds. Travellers planning a visit to China should take preventative measures to avoid bird flu symptoms, it added. The best way to avoid the infection is to steer clear of any poultry farms or animal markets while in China. It's also important to avoid contact with animal waste, or any untreated bird feathers, added PHE. Make sure that all poultry, egg or duck meals are cooked all the way through and do n't touch any dead, or dying birds. While spending time in China, you should also make sure you wash your hands regularly with warm, soapy water, or use alcohol-based hand sanitisers.";"EN";2019-02-20 10:23:00;"1 6";

KUWAIT: Commenting on fears concerning rumors about people infected with bird flu, Ministry of Health ( MoH ) Undersecretary Dr Majeda Al-Qattan denied any such cases and stressed that all poultry products and birds in the local market had been examined and that none of them pose any threat. Qattan also explained that eight cases had been thoroughly examined over suspicions of being infected with bird flu but all diagnosis results came negative. 
General assembly meeting Kuwait Teachers Society ( KTS ) Chairman Mutee Al-Ajmi announced that the administrative court issued an expedited ruling on the validity and legality of the measures followed by KTS to call for a general assembly meeting, according to correspondence with the Ministry of Social Affairs. Speaking at a press conference held yesterday, Ajmi said the ruling emphasizes the legality of the measures KTS followed to hold a general assembly meeting on February 19. `` However, the ministry's representatives acted strangely and left the meeting for no reason, '' he remarked, explaining that due to a lack of quorum at the time set to start the meeting ( 4 pm ), a legal measure was taken to postpone the meeting for half an hour and then hold it with whoever was present, which had been used for years. `` This raises a huge exclamation about such an unjustified action by the ministry '', he said. Meanwhile, Ministry of Social Affairs ' acting undersecretary Hana Al-Hajeri said the ministry requested postponing the KTS general assembly meeting to finalize the measures stipulated in article 25 of its law and to protect members ' rights. Hajeri added that the ministry's representatives were present, but found only a few of KTS ' 10,578 members had shown up to attend the meeting, and thus the meeting was postponed for two weeks in accordance to the law for lack of quorum. 
Outstanding women A total of 112 women from 20 countries are nominated to take part in the Kuwait International Award for Outstanding Women, including 70 Kuwaitis and 42 others from the US, Europe, Asia and Africa, Security General of the General Secretariat of the Supreme Council for Planning and Development Khaled Mahdi announced yesterday. Mahdi explained that Kuwaiti nominees include 41 working in the government sector, 28 working in the private sector and 43 from various NGOs, noting that the nominees will be interviewed and the winners will be honored in a special ceremony on March 6, 2019.

CDC ends probe of Salmonella raw chicken outbreak after 129 cases. 
Without being able to pinpoint a specific source of contamination, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) yesterday declared an end to its investigation of an outbreak of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Infantis infections after confirming 129 cases in 32 states, including 25 hospitalizations and 1 death. The CDC first alerted the public to the outbreak on Oct 17, 2018, and since then the outbreak has grown by 37 cases, 3 states, and 4 hospitalizations. The agency had not confirmed the death, in a person from New York, until yesterday. `` Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicated that many types of raw chicken products from a variety of sources are contaminated with Salmonella Infantis and are making people sick, '' the agency said in its final statement on the outbreak. However, it said illnesses could continue, because the Salmonella strain appears to be widespread in the chicken industry. In interviews, people reported eating different types and brands of chicken products. Officials confirmed the outbreak strain in samples taken from raw chicken products, raw chicken pet food, and live chickens, but they could not identify a single, common supplier. Therefore, no food recall was initiated because of the outbreak. Illness-onset dates range from Jan 8, 2018, to Jan 27, 2019. Patients range in age from less than 1 year to 105, with a median age of 42, and 69 % are female. Of 69 people interviewed, 60 ( 87 % ) reported preparing or eating chicken products that were bought raw, including ground chicken, chicken pieces, and whole chicken. One person got sick after pets in the home ate raw ground chicken pet food, and two patients live with someone who works in a facility that raises or processes chickens. The CDC said it and the US Department of Agriculture are working with the poultry industry to explore ways to reduce Salmonella Infantis in chicken products. Feb 21 CDC update Oct 17, 2018, CIDRAP News scan Afghanistan, Pakistan report wild poliovirus cases. 
Both Afghanistan and Pakistan recorded recent wild poliovirus type 1 ( WPV1 ) cases, according to the latest update today from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ). In Afghanistan, a patient from Kandahar province experienced symptom onset on Jan 12. This is the second WPV1 case recorded in 2019 in Afghanistan. The country recorded 21 cases in 2018. In neighboring Pakistan, two cases were recorded, both with onset of paralysis on Jan 20. The cases originated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces. These cases raise Pakistan's 2019 total number of WPV1 cases to 4, compared with 12 last year. The GPEI also noted the Feb 20 meeting of the World Health Organization's International Health Regulations and Emergency Committee, which unanimously agreed that the risk of polio spread continues to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Feb 22 GPEI update Officials detail how contaminated water supply caused campylobacteriosis. 
Municipal water supply contaminated with livestock waste runoff was the cause of a campylobacteriosis outbreak in Nebraska in 2017, according to a study today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports ( MMWR ). The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services was notified of 39 cases of illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni in March 2017, and the only shared exposure associated with illness ( odds ratio, 7.84; 95 % confidence interval, 1.69 to 36.36 ) was to city tap water. `` A collaborative on-site investigation revealed that during the pumping of a large volume of livestock wastewater from a concentrated animal feeding operation through a center pivot irrigation system, the system malfunctioned at an undetermined time, '' the study authors said. The malfunction allowed wastewater to collect near two wells that served the city. Campylobacter infection is one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness in the United States, affecting an estimated 1.3 million people each year. It is often associated with eating raw or undercooked poultry. `` This investigation demonstrates the importance of considering exposure to untreated water sources as a potential cause for Campylobacter outbreaks. Including this risk factor in initial questioning could help to expedite outbreak investigations, '' the authors concluded. Feb 22 MMWR study Inovio targets Zika in first human trial of DNA monoclonal antibody. 
Inovio this week announced the launch of a trial of a DNA-encoded monoclonal antibody ( dMAb ) treatment, which will test its ability to prevent and treat Zika infection, the company said in a Feb 20 press release. Inovio is collaborating with The Wistar Institute and the University of Pennsylvania, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is funding the trial. The open-label, single-center dose-escalation trial will involve 24 healthy volunteers who will receive up to four doses of the dMAb, which is called INO-A002. According to the press release, the genetic codes provided by the synthetic dMAb trigger the body to make the therapeutic antibodies, meaning production of the monoclonal antibodies does n't rely on manufacturing in bioreactors, a fact that can speed development and cut costs.J. Joseph Kim, PhD, Inovio's president and chief executive officer, said the first human study of INO-A002 could provide important information about the platform, which could lead to production of other dMAbs targeting other infectious diseases, cancers, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. Feb 20 Inovio press release H5 avian flu outbreaks strike birds in China and India. 
In the latest highly pathogenic avian flu outbreak developments, China reported an H5N6 event in poultry and India reported more H5N1 detections in house crows. China's H5N6 outbreak occurred at a poultry farm in Yunnan province, which killed 463 birds and led to the culling of 55,917, Reuters reported today, citing a report from China's agriculture ministry. H5N6 has been implicated in outbreaks in China and a few other Asian nations, and though the virus is known to infect people, China is the only country that has reported human cases. India's agriculture ministry, meanwhile, reported three more H5N1 outbreaks involving house crows, two in different cities in Jharkhand state and one in Bihar state, according to separate notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). The outbreaks in Jharkhand state began on Jan 28, resulting in the deaths of 37 birds. The event in Bihar state began on Feb 1 in the city of Jehanabad, with the virus linked to 18 bird deaths. India has reported sporadic H5N1 detections in wild birds and poultry this year, including one reported last week in backyard poultry in Jharkhand.

The animal husbandry directorate has directed dealers of poultry items not to take unsold birds back to their poultry farms from the city market, following confirmation from a premier Bhopal lab two days ago that some crows died of bird flu at Oxygen Park here earlier this month. This apart, the directorate has directed poultry farm owners to send samples to The National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, in case abnormal deaths of birds are detected in their farm. Speaking to this paper, state animal husbandry director Chittaranjan Kumar said the directive was given two days ago after it was confirmed from the Bhopal lab that crows in the state capital had died of bird flu. The H5N1 ( avian influenza ) virus causes what is commonly known as bird flu. `` Our sole intention is to contain the disease for the safety of people and poultry. As the bird flu cases were detected in Ranchi city, I advised poultry bird dealers not to take back unsold birds ( chicken ) to their farms as it may cause them heavy loss, '' Kumar said. He also denied unconfirmed reports that the directorate had banned the entry of vehicles carrying poultry to the city. `` No ban on the movement of vans carrying poultry birds has been imposed, '' he said. `` The order to not take back unsold birds to farms is our precautionary measure. '' Most poultry dealers at the main markets of the capital, Morabadi, Karamtoli, Kantatoli, Ratu Road, Kutchery, Boreya, Hinoo and Doranda, seemed aware of the directive. Md Qurban, a Kantatoli chicken dealer, said he bought limited stocks to the city. `` We bring limited chicken from Boreya to the city market ( Kantatoli ) and try to sell all the stock. If demand is low, we even sell chicken at a lower price, '' he said. `` But so far, we find the demand for chicken is more or less the same. Chicken continues to sell for Rs 120 a kilo, the same as before '' he added. Some customers however said they had stopped consuming chicken after coming to know of the bird flu deaths. Bankim Chandra Seth, a computer operator in an MGNREGS scheme in Bundu, said he stopped eating chicken when he read that bird flu had been detected in Godda about 20 days ago. `` That was before this Ranchi case. But I thought, why take risks. I am not eating chicken since, '' Seth said.";"EN";2019-02-23 07:00:00;"1 6";

The Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences ( RIMS ) may soon start conducting molecular tests for H1N1 flu in Ranchi, officials from the premiere State-run hospital have said. 
At present, RIMS sends blood samples for Swine Flu test to Kolkata, which makes the process time consuming. Quicker test results are likely to help the hospital start necessary treatment sooner, say doctors. 
`` We are planning to set up a lab for RT-PCR ( Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction ) test at RIMS. The work is in progress, '' said Dr. Manoj Kumar, Head of the Department of Microbiology at RIMS. 
The RT-PCR is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of Ribonucleic Acid ( RNA ) to Deoxyribonucleic Acid ( DNA ). It is used to measure the count of a specific RNA in blood samples. 
There are set guidelines to conduct molecular tests for H1N1 flu in a bid to ensure that the test results are accurate and the lab activities do not cause any hazard to the environment. 
`` We need at least a Bio Safety Level 2 lab for conducting H1N1 tests. There are strict norms that we need to follow, '' Kumar said. 
This year RIMS has sent at least 26 samples for H1N1 test to Kolkata and has received only 21 reports. Reports for the remaining five samples are still awaited. The entire process takes at least four days to a week, doctors said. 
Jharkhand has been hit by a Swine Flu outbreak this year, with at least 26 cases of H1N1 flu reported from across the state. Twenty of the 26 cases are from Simedga, three from Ranchi and remaining three from Jamshedpur. The influenza virus has claimed one life in Ranchi so far this year. The situation appears to be alarming since only four cases of H1N1 Flu were reported in Jharkhand last year. 
Besides Swine Flu, the State also fears a possible occurrence of Bird Flu in Jharkhand after sudden deaths of several crows reported in parts of Bokaro. 
After death of a crow due to suspected H5N1 Avian Influenza in Ranchi's Morhabadi area, serum samples of around 100 domestic birds from the locality have been sent for tests to Bhopal, said Civil Surgeon Dr. VB Prasad. 
Officials from the Animal Husbandry Department said that lab tests of the crow confirmed that it died of Avian flu. However, this is not enough reason to panic since infected `` wild birds '' do not usually cause an outbreak, they added.";"EN";2019-02-23 17:33:23;"1 6";

An outbreak of Bird flu also known as Avian Influenza has been confirmed in Bauchi and Plateau states. 
The Director of the Federal Department Of Veterinary and Pest Control Services of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr Olaniran Alabi told Daily Trust in Abuja that the federal government in collaboration with the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations has dispatched officers to the affected two states. 
The team of experts has been dispatched with FOA Supporting. They are already in the field carrying out detail investigations and putting in all the necessary control measures. 
`` I have not gotten any report as to whether it has gone beyond those two states. The team that we send to the field one of the things they will be doing is also to determine the extent of the problem.

`` We have also supported with biosecurty materials we got from FAO in putting control measures to contain the disease, '' he said. 
In Jos, Dr Spak Shaset, the Chief Veterinary Officer of the state, told the News Agency of Nigeria ( NAN ) on Tuesday in Jos, that the outbreak had affected two farms in Jos North and Jos South Local Government Areas Plateau state, killing at least 3,900 birds. 
`` Sometime in January, when we heard of an outbreak of the dreaded disease in some parts of Bauchi State, we knew Plateau was at risk. 
`` I immediately summoned our divisional health officers in the 17 councils, and in less than 72 hours after we met, the report got to us of suspected cases in some farms in the state. 
`` We immediately swung into action and took samples from the farms to our labs and it was confirmed it is bird flu. 
`` Without hesitation, we went and depopulated the farms to avoid further spread of the disease to other farms. 
`` More than 3,900 birds were destroyed; 2,900 from the farm in Jos South and 1,000 in the farm in Jos North. '' 
Shaset said the two farms were decontaminated, disinfected and quarantined, to avoid further spread to nearby farms and have other poultry farmers incur losses. 
The official said the government had taken positive and stringent steps to avert further spread of the disease to other areas of the state. 
Shaset charged poultry farmers and live bird marketers to step up bio-security and hygiene measures within and around their farms and markets. 
He advised Plateau residents to avoid the sale, slaughtering and consumption of sick and dead birds, to avoid being infected. 
Meanwhile, the Director General of the Poultry Association of Nigeria ( PAN ) Dr Anallo S Akpa has advised farmers to step up bio-security in their farms. 
He enjoys them to prevent unnecessary movement of unauthorized persons, and materials in and out of their farms adding that farmers should be vigilant at all times. 
Although official of Poultry Association of Nigeria and the federal government are assessing and watching the situation closely but did not give the actual numbers of farmers or birds so far affected.

Disease X has been identified as the next global pandemic by researchers - but it does n't exist yet. Scientists are currently working to predict when the virus will emerge, with the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) warning last year conditions are perfect. Fears are circulating the illness evolves from a mutated form of influenza and healthy people could be most at risk. Dr Jonathan Quick, chair of the Global Health Council, has said: `` Our greatest fear is being blindsided by a new virus, most likely due to animal-human spillover, which then readily spreads from human to human, has at least a five to 10 per cent fatality rate, does not respond to existing medicines, and for which an effective vaccine and accurate diagnostic test can not rapidly be developed. '' Flu is an airborne illness which can mutate quickly, with some strains able to pass between species, such as bird flu. The prediction stated by Dr Quick could mean Disease X will be more fatal than Spanish flu. The Spanish flu pandemic began in 1918 and infected 500 million people around the world. It also resulted in the deaths of 50 to 100 million people, which equates to three to five per cent of the world's population.A study titled ` Pandemic Versus Epidemic Influenza Mortality: a pattern of changing age distribution ' claims the highest numbers of fatalities were unusually seen in people under the age of 65. Conclusions were drawn the stronger the immune system, the more vulnerable it actually was to Spanish Flu. Another theory is older generations, by the time the Spanish Flu emerged, built up more resistance to influenza infections through exposure to other strains, and as such, were better protected than younger generations. John-Arne Rotting, WHO science advisor, said: `` History tells us that it is likely the next big outbreak will be something we have not seen before. `` The point is to make sure we prepare and plan flexibly in terms of vaccines and diagnostics tests. '' Last year, one of the strains of flu which circulated the UK was H3N2 - dubbed Aussie flu. Britain was hit hard by Aussie flu, with symptoms described as being the same as normal flu but worse. But the H3N2 was a strain which has been dealt with before, and while it had the potential to be fatal to those at risk, such as young children and the elderly, it had no where near the impact Spanish flu and Disease X could have. Symptoms of ordinary flu. 
These can come on quickly, according to the NHS, and can include: A sudden fever - a temperature of 38C or aboveA sudden aching body. 
Feeling tired or exhaustedA dry coughA sore throatA headache. 
Difficulty sleeping. 
Loss of appetite. 
Diarrhoea or tummy pain. 
Nausea and being sick. 
Flu can often be treated without seeing your GP, and you should expect to feel better in about a week. If you develop sudden chest pain, have difficulty breathing or start coughing up blood you should call 999 or go to A&E.";"EN";2019-02-26 08:04:00;"1 6";

Latvian government has approved amendments developed by Agriculture Ministry on liquidation of risks of avian influenza, as confirmed by the ministry. 
Amendments to established rules provide a duty for the Food and Veterinary Service to set a period within which it is obligated to follow specific bio-security measures. One example is the prohibition to keep domestic birds in outside enclosures. 
Because highly pathogenic avian influenza spreads very rapidly, it is possible that it will be necessary to made immediate decisions to order domestic bird holders to perform specific measures within a specific period to reduce the risk of the virus ' spread from wild birds among domestic birds. 
To improve the level of awareness in the sector about dangerous pathogens and measures intended to restrict their spread, Healthcare Ministry has created a separate section for avian influenza on its website.

Warner urges the president to get China's ban on U.S. poultry lifted 
HARRISONBURG, Va. ( WHSV ) -- On Tuesday, Senator Mark Warner, D-Virginia, joined a group of senators in signing a letter to the Trump administration, encouraging it to get the bans from China on U.S. poultry lifted. 
The ban went into place four years ago after an outbreak of avian influenza, the bird flu, in chicken. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the avian influenza is a virus that occurs naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. 
At it's peak in 2008, poultry exports to China had a value of $ 772 million. 
According to the Virginia Poultry Federation, the poultry industry employs more than 17,000 Virginians each year and has more than 32,000 jobs in supplier industries. 
Hobey Bauhan, president of the Virginia Poultry Federation, said if the ban was lifted, it could have a significant effect on farms and jobs in the valley. 
`` Sixteen percent of chicken is exported, about 10 percent of turkey is exported, and so international markets are very important, '' Bauhan said. `` At one time, China represented about almost 20 percent of U.S poultry exports. '' 

Bauhan said the outbreak of avian influenza did n't even affect any poultry farms here in Virginia. 
Sen. Warner is just one of eight other senators who also signed the letter. 
`` Agriculture is of particular importance to our states ' economies, and we urge you to use this opportunity to support America's farmers by securing duty-free access for U.S. agricultural products and lifting the Chinese ban on U.S. poultry products, '' the letter said. 
President Trump said in his State of the Union Address in February that he is committed to ensuring a new trade agreement with China that would end unfair trade practices.";"EN";2019-02-26 23:44:03;"1 6";

CDC ends probe into multistate Salmonella outbreak tied to tahini products. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said today it has wrapped up its investigation into a Salmonella Concord outbreak tied to tahini imported from Israel after eight cases were confirmed in four states. The case count is up from five cases in three states in late November 2018, when the CDC first announced the outbreak. Illness-onset dates range from Apr 21, 2018, to Jan 3, 2019. No hospitalizations or deaths were reported. Massachusetts reported its first case, and Hawaii and Michigan also had one. New York's case load grew from three to five. On Nov 27, 2018, Achdut Ltd, of Ari'el, Israel, recalled tahini products because of the outbreak. Recalled products were sold under the following brands: Achva, Achdut, Baron's, Pepperwood, Soom, and S&F. `` Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicated that tahini products from Achdut Ltd. were the likely source of this outbreak, '' the CDC said. Officials detected no signs of antibiotic resistance in the outbreak strains they analyzed.

Today the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) announced a $ 34 million contract and new partnership with Cure. 
Vac AG, a biopharmaceutical company developing mRNA-based vaccines, to create a transportable RNA printer that could be used to develop vaccines in outbreak scenarios. `` This innovative platform will provide a rapid supply of lipid-nanoparticle ( LNP ) - formulated mRNA vaccine candidates that can target known pathogens ( including Lassa Fever, Yellow Fever, and Rabies ) and prepare for rapid response to new and previously unknown pathogens ( referred to by [ the World Health Organization ] as `` Disease X '' ), '' CEPI said in a press release. The device would be able to produce several grams of LNP-formulated mRNA -- enough for more than 100,000 doses -- within weeks of an outbreak, CEPI said. The technology could be encoded for multiple proteins and antigens, targeting different viruses. The project is set to begin next month. CEPI is a partnership among public and private organizations that was launched in Davos, Switzerland, in 2017 to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. It has committed to investing more than $ 350 million in 12 vaccine candidates and three vaccine platforms. Feb 27 CEPI press release Legislators reintroduce law to boost investment in universal flu vaccineUS lawmakers yesterday reintroduced legislation to support the development of a universal flu vaccine, calling for a total investment of $ 1 billion through fiscal year 2024. Called the Flu Vaccine Act, the bill was reintroduced by Sen Edward Markey, D-Mass., and Rep Rosa De. 
Lauro, D-Conn., according to a statement from Markey's office. The proposed law calls for $ 200 million for fiscal years 2020 through 2024 for the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ). Legislators have already secured a dedicated $ 100 million for fiscal year 2018 and $ 140 million for fiscal year 2019 for universal flu vaccine research at the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ). At a Congressional briefing yesterday, the Foundation for Vaccine Research updated lawmakers on the current flu season and progress on a universal flu vaccine. In the statement, Markey said American scientists are heavy hitters in health and disease research, and it is up to the United States to take the lead in improving and enhancing the response to flu. `` With increased research funding, hard-working health care providers, and brilliant scientific investigators, we are the [ closest ] we have ever been to ensuring a flu-free future. The bases are loaded, and the Flu Vaccine Act will help us knock this public health menace out of the park, '' he said. Senate cosponsors are Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Angus King, I-Maine, Tina Smith, D-Minn., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. These are virtually the same senators who introduced a similar bill about a year ago. In 2012, the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy ( CIDRAP ), which publishes CIDRAP News, led a group that published an in-depth analysis of problems with current flu vaccines and steps needed to develop a next-generation version with the capacity to minimize the impact of seasonal flu as well as a future pandemic. One of the report/s recommendations was to declare flu vaccines a national priority and dedicate substantial investment and leadership on the scale of the Manhattan Project, a massive effort that brought about the first nuclear weapons during World War II.

In the latest highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak developments, Nigeria and Pakistan reported H5N8 detections and Taiwan reported more H5N2 events in poultry, according to the latest notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). Nigeria's H5N8 outbreak began on Jan 28 in backyard birds, which were 16-week-old pullets, in Bauchi state in the central part of the country. The virus killed 105 of 460 susceptible birds, and the rest were destroyed. The source of the virus has n't been determined, but health officials suspect the purchase of adults birds from an unknown source. Nigeria has reported sporadic H5N8 outbreaks since the first of the year. In Pakistan, the agriculture ministry reported two H5N8 outbreaks involving wild birds, both in Islamabad. One outbreak began on Jan 2 and the other started on Feb 7. Affected birds include mallards, Guinea fowl, wild swans, and house crows. Between two events, the virus killed 64 birds, and officials euthanized 5 additional infected birds. The detections are Pakistan's first since February 2018. Elsewhere, Taiwan reported four more H5N2 outbreaks at poultry farms, three in Yunlin County and one in Changhua County. Native chickens and turkeys were affected. Taiwan has been battling H5N2 outbreaks since early 2015, and these latest ones began from Jan 26 to Feb 19. Of 65,496 susceptible birds across the four farms, the virus killed 4,260, and the remaining ones were destroyed to curb the spread of the virus.

Feb 28, 2019 

The U.S. government is quietly funding controversial scientific research to create airborne versions of highly infectious diseases, and the results of an experimental accident could be catastrophic, two public health researchers write in an op-ed published by The Washington Post today. 
Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, joins Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch in condemning research to enhance strains of bird flu to make the disease transmissible by air. Similar research previously sparked a public outcry and was discontinued in 2014. Officials at that time imposed a moratorium on such research until studies could be approved by a specially created review board to consider the dangers. 
This month, Science independently confirmed with the National Institutes of Health that funding had been approved for two studies, one conducted in the U.S. and one conducted in the Netherlands, that aim to enhance forms of bird flu. No additional information has been made public regarding the studies, the researchers involved, or the process that was or was n't in place to review them. 
`` Amazingly, despite the potential public-health consequences of such work, neither the approval nor the deliberations or judgments that supported it were announced publicly, '' Inglesby and Lipsitch write. `` The government confirmed them only when a reporter learned about them through non-official channels. '' 
They add that this kind of research is `` not ordinary science. '' Rather, they argue, these studies have the potential to create pandemic pathogens that could infect millions of people with a dangerous virus. Although the majority of scientific experiments are safe, Inglesby and Lipsitch suggest that the risks in this case outweigh the potential benefits for society. 
They continue: 

We have serious doubts about whether these experiments should be conducted at all. We also suspect that few members of the public would find compelling the rationale that the best way to fight the flu is to create the most contagious, lethal virus possible in a lab. But with deliberations kept behind closed doors, none of us will have the opportunity to understand how the government arrived at these decisions or to judge the rigor and integrity of that process.

By Luqman CloeteHIGHLY pathogenic avian influenza continues to wipe out penguins at the Halifax Island beach near Lüderitz. 
The Lüderitz Maritime Research Group estimated on its Facebook page that more than 500 penguins have died since the first bird flu outbreak towards the end of last year. 
`` Unfortunately, there is another confirmation that the mortality is continuing unabated. As of today, 345 penguin carcasses, excluding chicks, were recovered from the island and nearby beaches ... the real toll is by now probably in excess of 500 birds, mostly breeding adults, '' a recent post on the group's Facebook page reads. 
According to the group, they have noticed that most of the affected penguins are clustered around `` colony 2 '' on the south side of the island, and in particular near a muddy patch adjoining this colony. 
`` As the virus H5N8 can survive for weeks in a wet environment, we suspect that this mud patch might be a factor in the continuing mortalities as it is crossed daily by adult penguins returning from the sea, '' the Facebook post further reads. 
The group said the fisheries ministry's officials had recently spread buckets of salt over the mud patch in an attempt to lower the rate of infection. 

Dr Jean-Paul Roux, a member of the research group, who spoke to The Namibian yesterday, said the damage in terms of the dying penguins might be more serious because it is not known whether the outbreak had spread to the three adjacent Possession, Ichaboe and Mercury islands. 
Attempts to get comment from the fisheries ministry's De Wet Siluka on the situation proved futile as he did not respond to questions e-mailed to him on Tuesday. 
The agriculture ministry last week issued a warning to farmers on the outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza. 
Avian influenza, also known as avian flu, is an infectious bird disease caused by type A strains, which occur worldwide, although some bird species are more resistant than others. 
Acting chief veterinary officer Albertina Shilongo said this was the first avian flu outbreak in Namibia.

US measles total climbs to 206 cases. 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) today reported 47 more measles cases, raising the total since the first to the year to 206 cases in 11 states. For comparison, the CDC reported 372 cases for all of 2018, the most since 2014. Affected states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. Meanwhile, the number of outbreaks remained at six, which includes a large outbreak centered in Clark County in the area around Vancouver, Washington. In that outbreak, county officials reported 5 more cases, raising its total since early January to 70. No more suspected cases or possible exposure locations have been reported, and all but 2 patients are known to have been vaccinated. In New York, Rockland County officials reported 2 more cases, raising the total since September to 140, and an outbreak in an Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn has 121 cases as of Feb 26. In Illinois, a measles outbreak near Champaign-Urbana area involves 1 more case, raising the total to 5. Mar 4 CDC update With 9 new acute flaccid myelitis cases, CDC will switch to monthly reports. 
In a separate update, the CDC today confirmed 8 more 2018 acute flaccid myelitis ( AFM ) cases in the past 2 weeks, raising 2018's total number of cases to 223 reported in 41 states, and 1 more for 2019, raising this year's cases to 2. The 223 cases -- which are by a large margin the most US cases in 1 year -- were confirmed from 374 reports of patients under investigation ( PUIs ). The CDC said no deaths have been attributed to AFM in 2018 or 2019. The 2019 AFM cases have been diagnosed in patients from North Carolina and Utah, with the latter being a new case since the CDC's previous update on Feb 15. Texas has reported the most AFM cases in 2018, with 29. Colorado has 16 cases, Ohio and California have 14 each, and Washington state and New Jersey both have 11. Minnesota and Pennsylvania have each recorded 10. As of today, the CDC said it will update AFM counts monthly instead of biweekly because of a reduction in the number of PUIs.AFM affects the spinal cord, leaving patients -- almost always children -- with partial or total limb paralysis or muscle weakness. The cause of the disease is unknown, but 90 % of patients report upper respiratory virus symptoms in the weeks prior to limb weakness. In previous years the syndrome has been tied to enterovirus infections. Mar 4 CDC report Bangladesh confirms Nipah case in suspected family cluster. 
Lab tests in the investigation into the early February deaths of five family members in Bangladesh revealed that one was infected with Nipah virus, according to a report from the Daily Star, Bangladesh's largest English-language newspaper, which cited a statement from the country's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research ( IEDCR ). The family members are from Baliadangi upazila in Rangpur division in the far northwest of the country. IEDCR committees have conducted investigations at hospitals and other locations, collecting samples from health workers, as well as other family members, neighbors, and villagers. None of other family member tested positive. The IEDCR said it's not known if the patient whose sample was positive had a history of drinking raw date palm sap, a known risk factor for the disease because of virus contamination through bat droppings. The agency said the four others may have been infected by the individual whose samples were positive. Nipah virus is harbored by bats, which can transmit the disease to people and other animals. It is one of three priority areas targeted by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations ( CEPI ). In 2018, a Nipah virus outbreak in India's Kerala state was linked to 17 deaths. In 2018, Bangladesh recorded three Nipah virus cases, one of them fatal, according to a list from the IEDCR. Mar 4 Daily Star story IEDCR yearly distribution of Nipah virus cases Novel H5N2 detected at Egyptian farm; Denmark reports low-path H5Egypt's agriculture ministry yesterday reported a novel H5N2 avian flu virus on a duck farm, according to a brief agriculture ministry statement and Arabic media report translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary ( AFD ), an infectious disease news blog. The reports did n't say if it was a highly pathogenic virus or where the farm was located. Another Egyptian media report translated and posted by Flu.

In other avian flu developments, Denmark reported a low-pathogenic H5 outbreak at an organic layer farm in Terndrup in North Jutland County, according to a Mar 1 report to the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). The outbreak began on Feb 26, and the birds had subclinical infection. The holding has 7,000 hens, and all will be destroyed to curb the spread of the virus. So far, the source is n't known. Mar 1 OIE report on low path H5 in Denmark WHO agrees to extend public health emergency for polio. 
The 20th meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) nanimously agreed late last week that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern ( PHEIC ). During the meeting, which convened in Geneva on Feb 19, the group considered several developments, including a rising number of wild poliovirus type 1 cases, the international spread of circulating vaccine-derived polio in several African countries, and population movement, before deciding the PHEIC status needed to stay in place. `` The current situation calls for unabated efforts and use of every tool available, to achieve the goal in these most challenging countries, '' the WHO said. `` Particularly in the three remaining endemic countries, further engagement with senior levels of government and other key stakeholders is needed to advocate for polio eradication, and ensure all levels of government maintain a strong commitment until the job is done. `` Polio is endemic in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria. Several countries, including Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Somalia, have also reported recent cases. Mar 1 WHO statement";"EN";2019-03-04 21:21:27;"1 6";

Japan and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) yesterday handed over a project worth US$ 500000 to the Government, which is expected to strengthen the capacity of small-scale farmers to fight Avian flu and the fall armyworm. 
Japan provided the money for the project, which started late last year, while FAO worked directly with the Government to implement it. The project will enable the departments of Crop and Livestock and Veterinary Services to rapidly respond to the outbreaks of the fall armyworm and the highly pathogenic Avian influenza. 
Since the start of the project last year, 500 Government extension officers have been trained in 10 districts, and 500000 small-scale farmers will be capacitated to cope with the threats. 
For avian flu, the project has provided an active surveillance system consisting of two Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction machines that will be used for the rapid detection of influenza viruses, and for the fall armyworm, 340 Government extension officers will be provided with smartphones equipped with monitoring and early warning system for the pest. 
The system is a free application for Android from FAO. 
Speaking during the handover ceremony in Harare, Japanese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Toshiyuki Iwado said agricultural produce sustained livelihoods, hence the need protect it. 
`` Given the vital role that agriculture plays in the lives of most Zimbabweans, it is necessary to protect their livelihoods and food security, '' he said. 
`` It is of utmost importance that authorities, farmers and the public are aware of the outbreak or suspected outbreak as soon as it occurs. '' 
FAO Sub-Regional Coordinator for Southern Africa Mr Alain Onibon commended Japan for supporting the project, which he said touched on very important aspects. 
He said FAO experts will continue to offer technical assistance to the departments of Crop and Livestock and Veterinary Services regarding the provisions of participatory fall armyworm and Avian influenza surveillance. 
`` As we know, the poultry sector is highly dependent on maize grain as the major ingredient of commercial stockfeeds, and yet the fall armyworm is threatening the yields of maize in Zimbabwe, '' said Mr Onibon. 
In an interview with The Herald on the sidelines of the handover ceremony, Principal Director in the Department of Veterinary Services Dr Unesu Ushewokunze-Obatolu said the donation of machines will go a long way in preventing further disasters in the livestock and crop sectors. 
In 2017, Zimbabwe experienced an outbreak of bird flu which saw more than two million birds being culled to control the disease. Last year, a plague of fall armyworm that has spread to all the country's provinces infested nearly 150000 hectares, posing a serious threat to the maize crop.";"EN";2019-03-05 21:41:51;"1 6";

JAPAN has donated US$ 500000 to Zimbabwe to fight the fall armyworm ( FAW ) and the highly pathogenic avian influenza ( HPAI ). 
By Farai Mabeza 
The project which started in March 2018 is benefiting 500000 small scale farmers. It is being implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) working directly with the Government of Zimbabwe. 
Through the project, 500 government extension officers have been trained in 10 districts. 
`` The project has also strengthened the government's capacity in dealing with these threats. For HPAI, an active surveillance system consisting of two Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT-PCR ) machines will be used for the rapid detection of influenza viruses, '' a joint statement from FAO and the Embassy of Japan said. 
For the FAW, 340 government extension officers will be provided with smartphones equipped with the FAW Monitoring and Early Warning System ( FAMEWS ), a free mobile application for Android from FAO, for surveillance and monitoring of the pest. 
Speaking during the handover ceremony in Harare, the Japanese Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Toshiyuki Iwado, said that given the vital role that agriculture plays in the lives of most Zimbabweans, it is necessary to protect their livelihoods and food security. 
`` The erratic rains experienced in recent years have had a negative impact on farmers ' livelihoods. And the emergence and rapid spread of the fall armyworm and highly pathogenic avian influenza pose a further threat to the food and income security of these millions of small-scale farmers. 
`` If we do not control the spread of these threats, they could worsen an already dire food security situation, '' Iwado said. 
FAO interim Subregional Coordinator for Southern Africa, Alain Onibon, said that FAO experts would continue to offer technical assistance to the Departments of Crop and Livestock and Veterinary Services regarding the provision of participatory FAW and Avian Influenza surveillance. 
`` We are happy that Zimbabwe now has the capacity to screen samples for both the H and N components of the Avian Influenza virus. During the last outbreak in 2017, the samples had to be sent out to South Africa for confirmation; yet timely intervention is of essence when dealing with such highly pathogenic diseases, '' Onibon said. 
The funding assistance for this project has enhanced Zimbabwe's progress towards five Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ), which are SDG 1: Reduce rural poverty, SDG 2: Zero hunger, SDG 3: Good Health and Wellbeing, and SDG 5 ( gender equality ) and SDG 8 ( decent work and economic growth ) 
In May 2017, Zimbabwe experienced an outbreak of HPAI ( the H5N8 strain ). It occurred in a poultry breeding unit of one of the largest commercial poultry producers in the country, and resulted in 2 million birds being culled to control the disease. Poultry is an important part of people's diet and accounts for around one third of total meat consumption. 
Agriculture provides employment and income for around 70 percent of the population. With farmers in the country still struggling to cope with the effects of successive droughts in recent years, an uncontrolled outbreak of FAW or HPAI would only compound the effects on food security and people's livelihoods. 
`` This project has, therefore, greatly contributed to the ability of Zimbabwean smallholder farmers to cope with the threats of FAW and HPAI, thus ensuring their livelihoods and food security, '' FAO and Japan said in their statement.";"EN";2019-03-07 13:13:13;"1 6";

Ranchi-ites can now gorge on their favourite chicken preparations without worrying about the bird flu fear doing the rounds in the city. The Department of Animal Husbandry on Friday cleared the suspense saying that chicken was safe for consumption here. 
The department had sent at least 36 blood samples of domestic birds from across Jharkhand for H5N1 tests to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases ( NIHSAD ) in Bhopal where none of the samples tested positive. 
`` It is safe to consume chicken in Jharkhand. However, one should prefer curry preparations over tandoor items as a precautionary measure for the time being, '' said Chitranjan Kumar, Director with Animal Husbandry Department. 
Kumar said that the samples sent for test were collected from chicken shops and poultries in different localities of Ranchi and other important cities after a few crows died of suspected avian influenza. 
`` Only one crow had died of avian influenza in Morhabadi locality. We collected samples of domestic birds from shops within the periphery of Morhabadi and none of them tested H5N1 positive, '' he said. 
The Bird Flu scare had a marginal effect on the sale of chicken in Ranchi. However, the prices fell from Rs .140 per kilogram to Rs .130 per kilogram in some parts of the city in the past couple of weeks. The rumours had also affected the sale of chicken items at restaurants and eateries. A few smalltime eateries at educational institutions in and around Ranchi had stopped selling chicken items after Bird Flu rumours started doing the rounds. 
Manoj Kumar, a veterinarian at the Animal Husbandry Department said that Bird Flu was unlikely to make a return to Jharkhand once winter retreats. If at all a bird is infected, the virus will not survive once the chicken is cooked at a temperature above 100 degrees Celsius, he added. 
By now, only crows have died in Jharkhand of avian influenza and the death of crows is not considered a valid reason for sounding an alert, officials said. `` Yes, crows have died of the virus in Jharkhand but we do not sound alerts when a wild bird dies. At least one domestic bird has to test H5N1 positive for us to sound an alert in the state, '' said Kumar. 
Meanwhile, rumours were rife that some domestic birds died of avian flu in Godda district. However, the department is yet to find any concrete evidence indicating deaths due to H5N1 influenza in the district.";"EN";2019-03-08 17:31:31;"1 6";

Ranchi: Two seven-year-old children who were brought to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences ( RIMS ) Ranchi on March 5 and 7 have been tested positive for swine flu ( H1N1 ) on Saturday. The said kids were getting treated at different private hospitals and were referred to RIMS for tests. 

Speaking to TOI on Sunday, RIMS superintendent Dr Vivek Kashyap said: `` We had received two outdoor patients at the paediatrics ward and after preliminary examination their sample were collected and sent to Kolkata for lab tests as they were showing symptoms of swine flu. We received the tests results on March 9 and both the patients were tested positive for H1N1. RIMS administration has forwarded the test results to district health authorities and Integrated Disease Surveillance Program ( IDSP ) authorities who are tracking the patients now. '' 

With two more patients tested positive for H1N1 the total number of infected patients toll stands at 52 in the last two months which have been detected this season. Health department was on alert and had issued guidelines after cases of avian flu were detected in Ranchi, Bokaro and Godda districts. The first case came from Gomia block of Bokaro and Mehrama block of Godda districts when samples of crows and poultry were tested positive for H5N1 on January 28. Similar cases were also reported from Ranchi and Deoghar when samples of crows, maina and poultry were tested positive on February 7 and March 1 respectively putting the health machinery on red alert. 

A letter was issued by state's health secretary on February 8 directing all the districts to keep an extra vigil on people who are involved in poultry business and working in affected areas. The health officials are also directed to advertise the precautions in their hospital premises and to advertise the same in the affected areas to create awareness among the people about the disease. 

After the recent detection of cases the district IDSP authorities are tracking the patient so that they can be admitted at the isolation ward of RIMS for better treatment. `` We have tracked one of the patients and IDSP team is working with them to get them admitted at isolation ward. We are facing some difficulty in tracking the other patient and hopefully we will be able to do it in a couple of days, '' said V B Prasad, Ranchi civil surgeon. 

`` As the district IDSP team has been apprised about the situation, they will be carrying out screening in the respective areas from where the cases have been reported and if anyone is found to be a suspected case their samples will be collected for tests, '' added state IDSP officer Dr. Rakesh Dayal.";"EN";2019-03-10 23:01:00;"1 6";

Mumbai -- Virkon ™ S, one of the world's leading veterinary disinfectants, from specialty chemicals company LANXESS, has helped contain the recent outbreak of Avian Influenza ( commonly known as Bird Flu ) in the Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, Patna in Bihar. 
Incidentally, the presence of H5N1 strain of Avian Influenza was first detected in Bihar from the viscera of dead birds in six villages of Asarganj block in Munger district of Bihar on December 21. The report of the bird flu outbreak led to the culling of over 1400 birds in Munger district alone and another 100 in Patna. 
Virkon ™ S is recognized worldwide as the disinfectant of choice for the emergency disease control of Avian Influenza. Sanitization work for the containment of bird flu in Patna zoo was successfully performed by local authorities and Virkon ™ S has been independently proven to be effective against highly pathogenic Avian Influenza virus strains. It has also been sprayed in the lion, tiger and leopard enclosures as a precautionary measure. 
Studies carried out by independent international test laboratories have proven that Virkon ™ S inactivates highly pathogenic Avian Influenza strains with a short contact time and in the face of challenging farm conditions such as heavy organic challenge, dilution by rain water and a wide range of temperatures, and the broad range of disease-causing organisms that can exist on farms. Virkon ™ S is recommended for use at a dilution rate of 1:100 for preventative and continuous biosecurity measures to provide high levels of efficacy. 
The highly efficacious nature of Virkon ™ S has been demonstrated in a series of tests against members of the orthomyxoviridae virus family ( including Avian influenza H5N1 ), and, by association, would be expected to inactivate the H5N8 strain. 
In recent years, India has suffered multiple outbreaks of Avian Influenza H5N1 and it is becoming a growing concern for poultries. Various factors like high density of poultry population, movement of poultry and poultry products from infected areas within the country and mixed rearing of chickens has made India vulnerable to primary incursion of Avian Influenza. The main source of such outbreaks are the migratory birds that fly in from Siberia into India and is further spread by the inward movement of the infected birds within the country. 
Anand Muthureddy, Head -- Business Unit Material Protection Products, LANXESS India, commented, `` Our product Virkon ™ S has proven to be highly effective in tackling such highly contagious diseases as we have put in a lot of R&D and testing behind it to make it a potent measure against such diseases and outbreaks. We are happy to be able to help the local authorities in containing the avian influenza outbreak effectively. ''

LÜDERITZ - Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources scientists found 27 penguins dead and three sick birds showing symptoms of Bird flu, even with the efforts from the ministry to control the spread of the virus. 
The scientists continue to take necessary measures to contain the infection as well as prevent further spreading by collecting and burning dead carcasses, isolating sick birds showing symptoms as well as disinfecting wet areas around the colonies where most dead birds have been found. The wet areas were disinfected by spreading salts on the mud pools at the colonies and covering it up with beach sand. The fisheries biologist under the Seabirds and Offshore Islands Section, Desmond Tom, indicated that a virologist from University of Namibia is willing to do DNA sequencing for viral genomics, discovery and evolution with the assistance of veterinarians from SANCCOB, Cape Town, South Africa. He said they are continuing to put salt and isolation of sick ones from healthy penguins to control the spread of the virus, as the virus needs to run its course, as there is no vaccine for it. The ministry of fisheries ' officers started visiting the Island weekly after the swab samples collected on penguins last year at Halifax Island in Lüderitz and tested by the Central Veterinary Laboratory, tested positive of Avian Influenza H5N8. Avian influenza refers to infection of birds with Avian Influenza Type A virus. It occurs naturally among wild birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird species. 
The H5N8 virus Type A can not survive brine ( salty ) conditions. The officials pay regular visits if possible ( once per week ) to the island and repeat these procedures to avoid further spreading of the virus. They also carry biosecurity measures on the island, on board the research vessel ( RV Anichab ) and at the Seabird Rehabilitation Facility to avoid further spreading of the highly pathogenic virus. 
The report indicated the death of penguins on Halifax Island was discovered mid December 2018 to date. More than 500 penguins, mostly adults have been reported dead even though chicks and juveniles are also affected. 
Halifax Island is situated about 10 kilometres west of Lüderitz near Diaz Point, about 100 metres off the mainland. It is the second most important breeding site for African penguins and is home to about 7000 penguins that contribute to the entire population of about 26000 penguins in Namibia. The African penguins are endangered seabirds in Namibia and they are endemic to Namibia and South Africa.

Colorado Parks and Wildlife asks that you do n't handle dead waterfowl, but report it for removal instead. Ducks and geese death reports are on the rise in the Denver metro area. Colorado Parks and Wildlife said that it has seen an uptick in waterfowl deaths recently, and necropsies of the birds in question luckily ruled out avian influenza viruses and Newcastle disease, but did identify the culprit: a bacterial infection caused by Riemerella anatipestifer, otherwise known as `` new duck disease. `` It's not great news for the large flocks of ducks and geese that call the Denver area home throughout the year. Geese especially have been flocking to Denver in droves over the last several years, making most parks, open water sources, and sports fields home sweet home. According to CPR.org, each winter an average of 180,000 geese descend on our state, not including those that live here year-round. `` The Denver metro area is home to large populations of resident Canada Geese year round. In addition, large migratory flocks of geese make temporary residence in the Denver area during the winter months. These large, congregated flocks create ideal conditions for various illnesses to travel among their populations, '' said CPW in a statement. Some of the symptoms of new duck disease in waterfowl include weakness, tucked-in head, neck tremor, and incoordination, among others. It is spread through bird-to-bird direct contact, toenail scratches, and common water/feed sources that the birds tend to congregate around. While it is generally found in waterfowl, it can also cause disease in chickens, turkeys, game birds, and more. If you see a dead, sick, or strange-acting waterfowl, it's best to just leave it be and report its location. `` If the public observes dead waterfowl, you can report it to the local park/managing entity for removal. Do not make contact with dead or sick waterfowl and do not allow your pets to have interactions with them, '' CPW requests. If you have questions or concerns, you can contact the CPW Northeast region service center at 303-291-7227.";"EN";2019-03-11 13:20:19;"1 6";

New research has revealed the impact of the European outbreak of avian influenza ( AI ) in 2016 and 2017 on Italian poultry producers and developed strategies for better control if a similar situation arises. 

Over the period, more than 1,200 outbreaks hit European producers, with high mortality rates and huge economic losses. The virus was spread primarily by wild waterfowl, with hundreds of cases reported across the continent. 
2.7 million domestic birds affected 
Italy was heavily affected, according to Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie ( IZSVe ) an Italian public health authority. Some 2.7 million domestic birds were affected across 83 farms, mostly in the north of the country. 

The outbreaks occurred in 2 distinct epidemic waves: 

The first between December 2016 and May 2017 
The second lasting between July and December 2017. 

The virus circulation was markedly more intense in the second epidemic wave, leading to 67 outbreaks in poultry farms ( about 80 % of the total cases recorded in domestic birds ). 
And control reportedly cost some $ 40m in the country. 
Approving the future management of epidemics 
With the aim of improving the future management of epidemics, a team of researchers at the IZSVe, composed of epidemiologists and virologists, adopted a multidisciplinary approach integrating epidemiological and phylogenetic information, allowing to reliably track the disease spread among farms and to re-modulate the containment strategy almost in a real-time fashion. 
Information collected on-field via epidemiological investigations ( e.g. affected species, geographical distribution, movements of people, animals, and vehicles, and environmental characteristics ) were integrated with the results of genomic analyses, to assess how the epidemiological situation was evolving and to detect how the disease could have spread among farms. 
`` In general, such analyses are made after the conclusion of the epidemic, due to time constraint and efforts requires; in this case the potential routes related to the disease spread were detected and corroborated during the epidemic events, '' said the report, which was published in the open access journal Scientific Reports. 
`` This proved paramount for the competent authorities, to define an array of suitable preventive measures to contain the disease and prevent its uncontrolled spread. ''";"EN";2019-03-11 13:22:27;"1 6";

Researchers at St. Louis University are recruiting volunteers to test a new vaccination for avian influenza. The vaccination targets the H7N9 strain, which has caused at least 600 deaths since it first surfaced in China in 2013. The National Institutes of Health has identified the strain as one that could cause a global pandemic and is now preparing for an outbreak before it happens. Five separate outbreaks of H7N9 avian influenza have surfaced over the past six years, sickening more than 1,500 people. Nearly 40 percent of patients have died. According to the World Health Organization, all reported cases have occurred in China or involved people who had recently traveled there. The fear is that this strain may mutate enough that it could be transmitted from human to human. ( Sharon Frey, SLU ) The H7N9 virus passes from domestic poultry to humans, said Sharon Frey, director of the SLU Center for Vaccine Development. `` The people who work in the poultry industry are surrounded by these birds, very close to them, '' Frey said. China instituted a policy of vaccinating chickens against H7N9 in 2017, which reportedly led to a 93 percent decline in poultry infection. Given the high mortality rate of the strain, however, public health officials in the U.S. remain concerned about the possibility of a global pandemic. The strain rarely passes from person to person, but Frey said that could change if the virus mutates. `` The fear is that this strain may mutate enough that it could be transmitted from human to human, '' Frey said. `` That could cause a pandemic, which would most likely be very severe. '' The ability of flu viruses to mutate also makes it especially challenging and time-consuming to develop human vaccinations to combat them. SLU is part of a network of seven research sites that will test the vaccination against H7N9. Frey said they are looking to recruit up to 80 healthy volunteers that reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of the greater St. Louis population. Paid volunteers will receive two doses of the vaccine 21 days apart. Researchers will then collect blood samples from each participant to assess their body's immune response and test whether antibodies in their blood can effectively fight the virus. The ultimate goal, Frey said, is to be prepared long before a virus outbreak surfaces. `` When there's a severe pandemic, you have to be ready to have vaccine to distribute as quickly as possible, '' she said.

SEJONG, March 12 ( Yonhap ) -- South Korea's agricultural ministry said Tuesday it will carry out stronger inspections at major locations to prevent the possible outbreak of bird flu ahead of the growing season. 
The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said it will investigate major traditional markets, fertilizer plants, and other places where eggs and birds are traded, throughout the end of this month following the seasonal increase in sales of midsized chicks. 
The demand for fertilizer, which contains organic materials, also increases during the growing season, posing potential risks, the ministry added. 
The officials plan to visit such locations to make sure they comply with existing quarantine guidelines. 
Traditional markets will also be shut down for two days in March to carry out comprehensive disinfection measures. 
The ministry plans to fine violators and keep track of them until they fully improve their preventive actions, it added. 
Bird farms located near the paths of migratory birds will also be subject to stronger quarantine measures, the ministry said.";"EN";2019-03-12 01:00:00;"1 6";

The influenza A virus -- known for causing `` bird flu '' and `` swine flu '' -- can affect both people and animals. The virus is able to jump to new species, where it can cause more severe symptoms, according to an announcement from The Roslin Institute in the U.K. 
Now, a new study led by Dr. Finn Grey of The Roslin Institute aims to identify genes that are involved in the influenza virus jumping species, specifically among chickens, swine and people. 
According to Grey, these species jumps are relatively rare because the virus has to adapt to the new species and because a specific `` arm '' of the immune system -- called the host interferon response -- represents a significant barrier to the virus spreading from animals to people. 
The Roslin-led study will investigate which genes are important for inhibiting replication of influenza A virus in pigs and chickens and which genes of the host interferon response limit the spread of the virus from animals to people. 
The study will help virologists better understand how to combat influenza strains. 
Work will be conducted in collaboration with Roslin scientists Paul Digard, Kenneth Baillie and Jacqueline Smith as well as Sam Wilson from the Centre for Virus Research of the University of Glasgow in Scotland. 
`` Research of livestock influenza infections is critically important, both in terms of economic burden and the potential for pandemic human outbreaks. This research, along with the recent development of genome-wide CRISPR libraries for livestock species, places The Roslin Institute at the forefront of cutting-edge systematic approaches in livestock species, '' Grey said.

US measles cases reach 268 as outbreaks grow in New York, New Jersey. 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) today said measles counts have now grown to 268 cases in 15 states -- 62 more cases than the agency reported in a Mar 4 update. For comparison, the CDC reported 372 cases for all of 2018. Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas, and Washington, have all recorded cases. So far, the CDC has identified six outbreaks that involve 3 or more cases, in New York City; Rockland County, New York; Washington state, Texas, Illinois, and California. `` These outbreaks are linked to travelers who brought measles back from other countries such as Israel and Ukraine, where large measles outbreaks are occurring, '' the CDC said. The United States had 17 outbreaks in 2018. Over the weekend, both Sullivan County, New York, and Ocean County, New Jersey, reported measles cases for the first time this year. Local news outlets in both communities reported two cases in each locality.

Saudi Arabia over the past few days reported three new MERS-CoV cases in three difference cities, according to an update to the Ministry of Health's ( MOH's ) epidemiologic week 11 report. On Mar 15, the MOH reported two of the cases, one of which involves a 41-year-old man from Abha whose exposure to MERS-CoV ( Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ) is under investigation. The other patient is a 73-year-old man from Najran whose exposure to the virus is listed as primary, meaning he probably did n't contract MERS from another person. Both Abha and Najran are located in southwestern Saudi Arabia. The third case -- reported on Mar 16 -- involves a 50-year-old man from Al Kharj, located in central Saudi Arabia. The report did n't detail any exposure but noted that the man has recovered. None of the three men reported recent camel contact, a known risk factor. Saudi Arabia has now reported 105 cases in 2019, including 57 linked to a large outbreak in Wadi ad-Dawasir that is mostly associated with healthcare exposure, though some illnesses were related to camel exposure. In other MERS-CoV developments, Saudi Arabia's agriculture ministry yesterday reported that camels at a livestock market in Arar, located in the north, have tested positive for the virus, according to a notification from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). Of 10 susceptible camels, 2 tested positive. Last week the MOH reported a human case in Arar, in a 42-year-old man who had a history of contact with camels.

For the 2019 - 20 flu season, the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) said parents can feel free to choose either the injected or inhaled flu vaccine. `` All children six months and older should receive the flu vaccine, in whatever form their pediatrician recommends, '' said Bonnie Maldonado, MD, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in statement. '' Every year, we are never sure if the vaccine strains are going to be perfectly matched up with incoming flu strains, but based on the information that we have now, we believe the nasal spray is an acceptable option. `` Before this season, the APP recommended the injectable vaccine over the inhaled version, citing recent studies that showed the injected vaccine was more protective than the spray vaccine. During the 2016 - 17 and 2017 - 18 flu seasons, the APP did not recommend the spray at all. But reformulations of the inhaled vaccine have made it a strong option for children, the AAP said. In other AAP news, during the AAP's annual leadership forum the group called for the elimination of religious exemptions to vaccination to be the top priority for the year, according to a news release. Ending religion exemptions topped the list of 10 resolutions, which also included safeguarding children's health at the US-Mexico border and curbing to e-cigarette use among students. `` Given the measles outbreaks, prioritizing the elimination of religious vaccine exemptions is a timely undertaking, '' said AAP President Kyle E.

Health officials in Bangladesh are investigating another suspected Nipah virus cluster, which if confirmed would be the second of the year, according to a local media report posted on ProMED Mail, the online reporting system of the International Society for Infectious Diseases. The patients are a 28-year-old woman and her two children, ages 8 and 4, who are from Baliadangi upazila in Thakurgaon district, the same area where a fatal five-person family cluster was reported in early March. In the new suspected cluster, the three people became ill with fever, headache, and vomiting and were admitted to Rangpur Medical College Hospital on Mar 14. The woman's husband said his wife and children got sick after eating jujube fruit on Mar 13. According to the media report, samples were collected for testing, and a medical team from the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control, and Research is slated to visit the hospital.

Despite the culling of thousands of chickens, the bird flu scare shows no sign of abating in districts of the Santhal Pargana division in Jharkhand. In the past two days, a large number of pigeons have died in the Chilra and Patharkani villages in Pathargama block of Godda district, around 339km away from the state capital Ranchi. The pigeon deaths -- these were birds owned by some villagers -- have made people in the surrounding villages fearful, as they are afraid of the virus spreading to other domestic birds. Pathargama block development officer ( BDO ) Rudra Pratap told the media that a doctor of the animal husbandry department, Dr Ashif Ahmed, had been sent to affected villages to collect samples. The samples would be sent to a Bhopal laboratory for tests; if the samples tested positive for birds flu, preventive action would be initiated, he added.A team of the animal husbandry department reached the affected villages and buried the dead pigeons in a deep hole outside the village. The officials said that there was no report of any other bird deaths ( chicken or crow ) from any other village. Villagers said that 16 pigeons of Ramesh Marandi were found dead in Patharkani village on Sunday, while 17 pigeons of Kapil Bhagat and Basuki Bhagat had died on Saturday. Villagers in surrounding areas now fear losing their chickens and pigeons to the virus. `` Deaths of pigeons have been occurring in the village for the past one week. When a large number of them died on Sunday, we informed officials, '' said Kapil Bhagat. Chilra panchayat chief ( mukhiya ) Mahadeo Tudu said that since the bird flu virus was found in the nearby Meherma block of Godda district, villagers feared that the infection was spreading. So, he added, the district administration was requested to initiate confidence-building steps for villagers until the sample test report arrived. The bird flu virus has so been found in the Godda and Deoghar districts of Santhal Pargana division.

Mar 19, 2019 - Veterinary technicians deployed from the Department of Livestock Services have culled over 67,000 chickens in Hetauda of Makwanpur, Tarakeshwor and Tokha of Kathmandu, and Madi of Kaski districts. 
Officials at the department said that the fowls were culled after the Central Veterinary Laboratory confirmed the presence of the H5N1 virus in the samples collected from those farms. 
Bimal Kumar Nirmal, Director General at the department, said that the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development had taken the decision after receiving the confirmation. Vet technicians completed the culling operations at 3:30 am today in Hetauda, according to him. Over 42,000 chickens were slaughtered. 
Likewise, vet technicians completed operations at 9:30 pm on Sunday in Tarakeshwar and Tokha municipalities of Kathmandu. Over 25,000 chickens of 20 poultry farms were killed there. Nirmal informed that the contagious virus was confirmed in samples of 13 poultry farms, but officials decided to destroy fowls of seven additional farms located in the vicinity. 
The H5N1 influenza virus has also been detected at Yangjakot of Madi Rural Municipality in Kaski district. The authorities concerned on Monday imposed a ban on the consumption and sale of fowls and its products in the area. Livestock Disease Research Laboratory in Pokhara said the avian flu was detected in chickens belonging to a Santu Pariyar in Yangjakot. 
The laboratory test confirmed the virus on March 12, and a meeting of stakeholders was held under the chairmanship of Chief District Officer Chakra Bahadur Budha Budha on Monday. The meeting concluded that affected areas would be kept under surveillance and security measures would be taken to control the disease. As per the decision, a technical team reached the affected area and culled 77 chickens and destroyed 85 eggs and 35 kg of feed belonging to Santu and four other neighbours. 
Livestock Service Training Centre in Kaski collected 17 samples of chickens from Yangjakot. Among them, one was confirmed with the H5N1 virus. 
Meanwhile, the Department of Livestock Services said that surveillance has been increased and surveillance staffers have been asked to bring samples of dead chickens for laboratory check ups to ascertain the cause of the chicken's death. Poultry farmers from various parts of the country have been contracting vet officials to report the death of their chickens, according to Nirmal. 
He said that his department would recommend the government to provide compensation to the farmers. 
The department has requested consumers not to be panic and to wash hands properly with soap and water after touching chickens, chicken feed and chicken manure and ensure that the meat is cooked properly before consumption.

ISLAMABAD: Dozens of birds and animals died at the Islamabad Zoo under the supervision of Capital Development Authority ( CDA ) and Metropolitan due to negligence and bad performance of the ineligible officials. 
At least 48 birds, eight Nilgais, a deer and monkeys and four lioness cubs have recently died in the Zoo. 
Sources said that sub-standard medicines have been given to the birds in order to save them from bird flu but instead of reviving to their health, every year hundreds of birds died due to these low-quality medicines. 
Ostriches have also been died due to bird flu. On the other hand, animals at the Islamabad Zoo worth hundreds and thousands of rupees have been handed over to high officials of political and social sector as a gift and no one dare to ask from the zoo staff in this regard. Watermotor at Zoo has also remained dysfunctional for two weeks in a month that is why animals at the Zoo fell in several diseases due to water scarcity and lack of quality food. 
Water motor could not be made functional despite spending hefty amounts on it several times. Moreover, animals were dying due to the negligence of Zoo director. The lioness had given birth to four cubs for three months ago but they died within two months due to lack of food and medicines. 
Sources said that hayracks of animals at Zoo were made through a contractor. Only Rs 20,000 had been spent on the construction of these hayracks but Zoo officials with their connivance passed bills of hundreds and thousands of rupees to a contractor from national exchequer. 
On the other hand, several tonnes of beef was brought at Zoo for Lion daily but was supplied to the houses of high officials instead of the lion. A voice has also been raised in the National Assembly regarding corruption in the beef ordered for the Lion at Zoo but no inquiry has been initiated till yet by the CDA or metropolitan besides food and medicines of the birds.";"EN";2019-03-19 15:01:06;"1 6";

Hanoi ( VNA ) - As 
many as 399 districts across Vietnam have been identified as high risk areas 
for the outbreak of bird flu while another 314 districts are at low risk, 
according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development ( MARD ). 
According to the 
national plan on avian influenza prevention and control from 2019 to 2025 
approved recently by the Prime Minister, the high-risk districts are those that 
fall into at least one of three categories. First, they are located in border 
provinces of Quang Ninh, Lang Son, Cao Bang, Ha Giang, Lao Cai, Lai Chau, Dien Bien 
and Son La.. 
Secondly, the 
districts had bird flu outbreaks or cases of bird flu reported at least twice 
in the last five years ( 2014 - 18 ) or within two years after they are removed 
from the low-risk district list. 
Thirdly, the 
high-risk districts have more than 3,000 poultry farming households, over 
100,000 poultry, over 100 duck farming households, or over 11,000 ducks. 
Low-risk districts 
are those that fall in at least one of following categories, including no bird 
flu outbreak or bird flu virus reported in the last five years, their poultry 
population is less than 100,000 poultry and less than 3,000 households raise 
poultry in a district. 
The low-risk 
districts have disease-free poultry production chains. 
Head of the 
Epidemiology Division under the Department of Animal Health Nguyen Van Long 
said on March 22 that the zoning which identifies high/low risk areas for bird 
flu outbreak is one of 12 key measures Vietnam is taking to better prevent and 
control bird flu until 2015. 
Other measures 
included disease detection, response and control, vaccination, animal 
quarantine, and poultry slaughtering control. The country will also develop 
more disease-free production zones and safe production chains in conformity 
with recommendations of the World Organisation of Animal Health ( OIE ), Long 
said. 
Now, there are six 
disease-free poultry production zones in Vietnam and 654 poultry farms are 
certificated disease-free. 
Deputy Minister of 
Agriculture and Rural Development Phung Duc Tien said monitoring the bird flu 
virus circulation effectively helps prevent and control bird flu. 
The Department of 
Animal Health cooperates with the Food and Agriculture Organisation and OIE to 
take poultry samples for monitoring each year. 
Tien called for 
continued international assistance to Vietnam in dealing with diseases 
including poultry diseases. 
In Vietnam, the avian 
influenza virus A/H5N1 in poultry was first reported in late 2003. At that 
time, Vietnam was one of the first countries to declare an epidemic of this 
virus and suffered heavy losses when more than 45 million poultry were culled between 
2003 and 2006. 
Between 2007 and 
2013, about 200,000 poultry were killed because of bird flu each year. Between 
2014 to March, 2019, about 90,000 poultry were killed because of bird flu each 
year. 
From 2004 to 2014, 
127 people were infected with A/H5N1, of them, 64 victims died. 
Since April, 2014, no 
one in Vietnam has been infected with bird flu. 
According to the 
agriculture ministry, over 12 million households across the country raise 
poultry, mostly on a small scale, which is said to cause difficulties in 
applying synchronised disease-free production measures.-VNA";"EN";2019-03-23 06:44:00;"1 6";

Chitwan, March 23 
Veterinary Hospital and Livestock Service Experts Centre Chitwan today dismissed rumours of bird flu outbreak Chitwan district. 

The office said people could use poultry products without any fear as no bird flu case was detected in the district. 
The office said so issuing a statement after a ban was imposed on the import of chicken and poultry products in several districts across the country. 
Centre chief Dr Bijaya Kumar Shrestha said although bird flu ( H5N1 ) cases had been reported in Makwanpur, Kathmandu and Pokhara, not even a single case of the flu was detected in Chitwan. 
`` Bird flu has been reported in neighbouring districts. However, Chitwan, which is the largest producer of poultry products, is safe, '' he said. 
According to him, bid flu was not detected in Chitwan as farmers in the district had become aware. 
The centre has been regularly collecting samples, testing them in laboratory and sending suspected samples for further testing to the Central Laboratory. 
The farmers also bring the dead chickens to the centre for testing. The centre has been collecting samples from chicken at weekly markets. 
More than five million eggs and 850 thousand kilos of chicken is produced daily in Nepal. 
Similarly, 2.7 million chicks of Broiler variety and 300 thousand chicks of Layers is produced. 
One hundred and 80 thousand people are directly employed in poultry business which contributes four per cent of the GDP. 
According to people involved in this business, Rs 100 billion is invested in the poultry business across the country.

MARIA SHAANIKASOUTH African veterinarian Frank Travers has urged local poultry farmers to use biosecurity to prevent chickens from getting infected with avian influenza. Travers, who is from the poultry veterinary services company Avimune in South Africa, was speaking last Wednesday during the ` poultry information day ' hosted by the Namibia Agricultural Union in Windhoek. He said bird flu is a killer disease and has no cure once a bird is infected. The disease is spread through bird migration and it spreads very fast, he said. Biosecurity involves putting multiple barriers to prevent anything that can carry diseases from entering the chicken coop, he explained. `` There must be a barrier between what is inside the chicken house and what is outside and the more barriers you have, the better biosecurity is, '' he continued. The veterinarian added that the virus could be carried on equipment, clothes or anything entering the coop which makes it difficult to contain once it enters the coop. Travers said one of the common signs of bird flu is bleeding, that can be identified by bruises on the legs and on combs. He added: `` By the time you see these signs, it would be too late because 95 % of the chickens will die. '' He added that other signs that could be observed in chickens although they are not really specific to bird flu, are chickens not eating, not laying eggs or `` just sitting around and feeling miserable. '' `` We were unfortunate to be part of an outbreak in the last two years in South Africa. The most scary thing is to walk into the chicken coop one day and you see a few combs that look like they are bleeding, and on day two, half of the chickens are dead. When you walk in on day three, you find all the chickens dead. I am serious, it is bad, '' he said. He said currently bird flu does not have any treatment and vaccination is not allowed, adding that the live vaccine might cause bigger problems. `` You ca n't prevent bird flu by vaccinating your chickens like you do for coryza and other diseases, '' he said. He added that there are new types of vaccines that people are looking at -- injections or a small portion of DNA material but they are not allowed unless the state agrees to the service. An outbreak of bird flu has been identified as the cause of the deaths of more than 500 endangered African penguins in the Lüderitz area in southern Namibia this year.";"EN";2019-03-26 03:22:57;"1 6";

Saudi Arabia confirms 2 more MERS infections. 
Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health ( MOH ) today reported two more MERS-CoV cases from different cities, according to updates to its epidemiologic week 13 report. One of patients infected with MERS-CoV ( Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ) is a 57-year-old man from Al Kharj in central Saudi Arabia who had contact with camels, a known MERS risk factor. The other is a 60-year-old woman from Hofuf in the country's east whose exposure to the virus is listed as primary, meaning she does n't have a history of contact with any known patients. She reported no recent camel contact. The latest cases lift Saudi Arabia's MERS-CoV total for the year to 109, which includes 57 linked to a large outbreak in Wadi ad-Dawasir that has mostly involved healthcare spread. Mar 27 MOH report China records new human H9N2 avian flu case in Jiangsu provinceA 9-year-old boy from Jiangsu province, China, is hospitalized in serious condition after contracting H9N2 avian flu, according to Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease tracking blog. This is the second human H9N2 infection recorded in China in 2019; in 2018, the country reported seven cases. The boy developed symptoms on Mar 15, and was likely exposed after contact with live poultry. Though H9N2 is common in poultry throughout Asia and the Middle East, the virus threatens humans by its ability to genetically reassort with other influenza strains, making it a potential pandemic threat. Mar 27 Avian Flu Diary post Chronic wasting disease found in captive South Dakota elk. 
South Dakota's state veterinarian, Dustin Oedekoven, DVM, confirmed the presence of chronic wasting disease ( CWD ) in a captive elk in Clark County, near the eastern border of the state, the Associated Press ( AP ) reported. The owner contacted a veterinarian when his 21-month-old female elk became sick, and the United States Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa confirmed the presence of CWD in the animal. Oedekoven said state and federal animal health officials are working with the owner of the affected herd to investigate the disease and mitigate further infection.CWD was first documented in South Dakota in 2001, in free-ranging deer and elk near the Black Hills. This is the first case of CWD in a captive elk since 2001, the AP report said. According to a press release from Oedekoven's office, South Dakota required mandatory CWD testing for all captive cervids ( deer and elk ) from 1997 until 2012. In 2012, the testing became optional, and the affected herd does not participate in the voluntary program. Mar 20 AP report Mar 20 South Dakota press release";"EN";2019-03-27 21:40:26;"1 6";

Fears of a bird flu outbreak gripped Odisha's Cuttack after 12 dead ducks were tested positive of H5N1 virus on March 31, 2019. Around 500 ducks and chickens have been culled since and 6,000 eggs destroyed. 
The ducks were tested after 224 of them died in a livestock breeding and dairy farm in Khapuria area of the city. 
`` After 224 ducks died in the farm on March 29, we collected samples of 18 of them and sent it to the Animal Disease Research Laboratory ( ADRL ) in Cuttack to ascertain the cause of death. Later, ADRL officials sent the samples to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases ( NIHSAD ), Bhopal, who found the virus in 12 ducks, '' said Loknath Behera, joint director, Animal Disease Research Laboratory, Cuttack. 
This is the first case of bird flu in Odisha this year. Such a scare has returned to the state after four months as the last one was reported in Sanasahi, Maluda, Alanda and Patharganj villages near Chilika lake in December. 
`` In Cuttack, so far, avian influenza remains confined to the duck population as no cases of any chicken or other birds being infected have been reported. We still culled more than 500 ducks and chickens within a kilometre of the farm and destroyed around 6,000 eggs. We also formed a rapid action team for this task. And, we are surveilling the 10-km area around Cuttack, '' added Behera. 
The administration is spraying sodium in the surveillance zone and instructing people to not consume chicken and duck for three months. Also, a compensation of Rs 130 for a duck, Rs 90 for a locally-bread hen and Rs 70 for a poultry chicken will be paid to poultry farmers. 
`` Avian Influenza A ( H5N1 ) is highly contagious and fatal. Most of the cases in which humans have been infected by the virus, which are n't many, have resulted from people being in direct or close contact with H5N1-infected poultry or H5N1 - contaminated surfaces, '' added Dr Behera.

The association made this known in a communiqué on Friday in Abuja at the end of its two day annual summit. It said that the reconstitution of the board, which was dissolved since 2015, was important for full implementation of veterinary laws and regulations in Nigeria. The communiqué was jointly signed by the NVMA National President, Prof. Bello Agaie, its General Secretary, Dr Oladotun Fadipe and its Publicity Secretary, Dr Gloria Daminabo. The summit congratulated the President Muhammadu for granting assent to relevant laws and regulations that would enable acquisition of veterinary knowledge and its practice in the country. It also commended the National Assembly in passing bills needed to strengthen the law governing the profession in line with global best practices. It added: `` The summit frowns at cumbersome nature of disease reporting system and recommended digitalisation for better data management and accessibility. `` The summit encourages more investment capacity building in quarantine services in the country. `` The summit observes the dearth of veterinary professionals in public service and urges federal, state and local government to do the needful. '' It appreciated the efforts of the government at controlling Antimicrobial Resistance, while advising that global best practices be adopted through the use of `` One Health '' approach. The summit participants also directed full implementation of the veterinary premises in all states regulations and the FCT in its entire ramifications. It also called on all NVMA members nationwide to be involved and show concerns in situation of emergency involving animal and man in line with the ethnics of the profession. The summit, which expressed its support for proposal by the National Executive Council to establish NVMA Foundation, also urged stakeholders to observe global best practices in their farms to checkmate outbreaks of Avian Influenza.

Novel technologies needed to combat IB in chickens31 March 2019 
Despite decades of vaccination, the world poultry industry's ongoing battle with infectious bronchitis ( IB ) continues to rage and points to the need for novel technologies to combat the disease, according to Haroldo Toro, DVM, PhD, Auburn University. `` The industry has done a lot, but we have not been able to control [ the disease ]. And you know, the first vaccines were produced in the 1950s, and here we are still talking about bronchitis, '' Toro told Poultry Health Today. 
The IB virus is extremely `` successful '' and is probably the most economically relevant virus in the poultry industry worldwide. It's always there, he noted, in contrast to avian influenza, which comes and goes. 
When the right IB vaccines are used at the right time, producers can expect reasonably good protection against the IB virus. That's not always the case, however, because of the changing nature of the IB virus, the lack of cross-protection and the ability of the virus to recombine. 
If flocks have IB virus strains A and B, for example, and are vaccinated only against strain A, they wo n't be protected against strain B, said Toro, who gave a keynote address titled `` Understanding the success of infectious bronchitis virus '' at the 2018 American Association of Avian Pathologists conference. 
`` So, what we need to do is invest in new, novel technologies, '' he said. 
`` Recombinant vaccines induce an immune response but do n't replicate in the host, but there are other vectors that could be used that would express a particular protein in a way that would also produce immunity against IB virus. '' 
Questions European approach 
Toro questioned an approach to IB virus control used in Europe that involves the use of vaccines with serotypes that are said to protect against other serotypes.

South Korea has lowered the quarantine alert status back to normal with no outbreak of bird flu this year, the government said Sunday. The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said it has ended the six-month special quarantine period for avian influenza as no highly contagious cases were discovered in the nation. ( AP ) A total of 70 AI cases were detected in wild bird droppings in the winter season, but all of them were identified as low contagious strains, the ministry said. `` As highly contagious AI has n't occurred in poultry farms, thanks to tough quarantine measures, they did n't suffer damages, like massive culling, '' the ministry said. Even after the special quarantine period ends, authorities will continue to monitor and disinfect local farms and inspect AI-prone regions to prevent potential cases, the ministry said.

`` The industry has done a lot, but we have not been able to control [ the disease ]. And you know, the first vaccines were produced in the 1950s, and here we are still talking about bronchitis, '' Toro told Poultry Health Today. 
The IB virus is extremely `` successful '' and is probably the most economically relevant virus in the poultry industry worldwide. It's always there, he noted, in contrast to avian influenza, which comes and goes. 
When the right IB vaccines are used at the right time, producers can expect reasonably good protection against the IB virus. That's not always the case, however, because of the changing nature of the IB virus, the lack of cross-protection and the ability of the virus to recombine. 
If flocks have IB virus strains A and B, for example, and are vaccinated only against strain A, they wo n't be protected against strain B, said Toro, who gave a keynote address titled `` Understanding the success of infectious bronchitis virus '' at the 2018 American Association of Avian Pathologists conference. 
`` So, what we need to do is invest in new, novel technologies, '' he said. 
`` Recombinant vaccines induce an immune response but do n't replicate in the host, but there are other vectors that could be used that would express a particular protein in a way that would also produce immunity against IB virus. '' 
Questions European approach 
Toro questioned an approach to IB virus control used in Europe that involves the use of vaccines with serotypes that are said to protect against other serotypes. The approach `` does n't work, '' he asserted, and said researchers have demonstrated it is not effective against US strains of IB virus. 
The perceived boost in protection `` may be just because of the invasiveness of [ a ] particular virus strain that they have been using, '' he reasoned. `` It just covers all host receptors, and the wild strain is not able to replicate. ''

Panic gripped the residents of Cuttack and nearby areas on Sunday, following an outbreak of bird flu in the city, prompting authorities to start culling of poultry. Samples collected from a state-run duck breeding centre at Khapuria on the outskirts of the city, have tested positive to the deadly strain of avian influenza, said District Chief Veterinary officer ( CDVO ) Loknath Behera. 

Veterinary teams, after receiving the test reports on Saturday, have undertaken a drive to cull all the poultry birds and destroy the eggs within one km radius of the duck breeding centre. Blood samples of the people within a 10-km radius of the locality, who have consumed eggs and bird meat over the week, will be collected, officials said. Reports said that the breeding centre witnessed deaths of at least 10 to 15 birds everyday over the past 10 days, following which samples were sent to several laboratories within the state and outside. The teams culled over 400 ducks within the breeding centre by Sunday evening. Similarly, huge quantities of chickens and eggs from nearby vending zones have also been destroyed. The drive will continue for a few more days, district officials said.

`` The samples tested positive for the H5N1 or avian Influenza virus, '' informed chief district veterinary officer Premananda Rout. `` Following the test report, we culled ducks and chickens. 
District veterinary office investigated into the incident and sent blood samples to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases ( NIHSAD ) in Bhopal. 
On March 23, as many as 13 ducks died on the day in the farm. 
The farms will remain closed for next six months according to guidelines, added Rout. 
Carcasses of culled birds were buried in 10 - foot dip pits.

Influenza A, known as ` bird flu ', is able to jump to new species, where it can cause more severe symptoms 

A new study aims to identify genes that are important in reducing ` bird flu ' and ` swine flu ', and genes that limit the spread of the virus to people. The Influenza A virus -- known for causing `` bird flu '' in poultry and `` swine flu '' in pigs -- can affect both people and animals. The virus is able to jump to new species, where it can cause more severe symptoms. Seasonal epidemic outbreaks cause significant disease and death in people. But now a new study led by the Roslin Institute, located at the University of Edinburgh, aims to identify the genes that are important in reducing such infections in livestock. Jumps to new species are relatively rare because the virus has to adapt to the new species and because a specific ` arm ' of the immune system -- called the host interferon response -- represents a significant barrier to the virus spreading from animals to people. This study will investigate which genes are important for inhibiting replication of Influenza A virus in pigs and chickens and which genes of the host interferon response limit the spread of the virus from animals to people. The study, which will receive over # 750,000 from the governments's Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, hopes to boost understanding of how to combat influenza strains. Meanwhile, researchers are developing gene-edited chickens designed to be completely resistant to influenza in a new approach to help stop the next deadly human pandemic. The first of the GM-edited chicks will be hatched later this year at the Roslin Institute.";"EN";2019-04-01 04:15:02;"1 6";

By Express News Service 
CUTTACK: The avian influenza has resurfaced in Odisha. This time, the outbreak has been reported from the Millennium City prompting bird culling and ban on poultry products. 
After some ducks of the Duck Breeding Centre of Livestock Breeding and Dairy Farm located at Khapuria died a few days back, the officials collected samples from the dead birds and sent those to the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases for test. The samples tested positive for the H5N1 virus on Friday. 

`` Immediately after getting reports of bird flu, we took permission from district administration and culled all the 435 ducks inside the Duck Breeding Centre on Friday night. 
Besides, around 6,180 eggs and 3.5 quintals of bird food were destroyed on the same night, '' said Bibekanada Mishra, an official at the Duck Fertilisation Centre adding that the culled ducks and the destroyed eggs and bird food were buried. 
On Saturday, Chief District Veterinary Officer ( CDVO ) convened an emergency meeting and ordered mass culling of birds within one km radius of the duck breeding centre. 
As many as 10 Rapid Response Teams ( RRTs ) have been formed for culling, mopping, surveillance, disinfection and sanitation, said Cuttack CDVO Dr Premananda Rout adding that the drive for culling of chickens has been intensified in nearby localities and necessary steps taken to prevent bird flu from spreading to other areas. 
Meanwhile, the Food Safety Department has put up notices in the area banning sale of poultry products. The prohibition will be in force for next three months. Residents of the city have been advised not to consume chicken and eggs. 
The bird flu was last detected in Krushnaprasad block of Puri district in December last year. It was suspected that migratory birds to Chilika lake might be the carriers of the flu though it is yet to be confirmed.";"EN";2019-04-01 05:00:00;"1 6";

US health agency changes India's status to `` current or past transmission but no current outbreak '' from the earlier `` ongoing outbreak '' 

Centre for Disease Control ( CDC ), a US health protection agency, has eased its December 2018 travel advisory to India over Zika outbreak, especially for pregnant women. 
The CDC had earlier cautioned pregnant women to not travel to India as there was an ongoing outbreak in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. On April 1, 2019, the Indian Council of Medical Research said its December rebuttal to CDC's earlier advisory has led the international agency to say the status of Zika outbreak has changed to `` current or past transmission but no current outbreak '' from the earlier status given to all south Asian nations -- `` ongoing outbreak ''. Also, the revised CDC advisory puts all countries in the clear from having an `` ongoing outbreak ''. 
However, it is not immediately clear if this rebuttal was actually behind this change. 
According to the CDC website, the advisory now states, `` India has reported past or current Zika virus transmission. We do not have accurate information on the current level of risk. There may be delays in detection and reporting of new outbreaks. Because Zika is a cause of severe birth defects, CDC recommends pregnant women and couples trying to become pregnant within the next three months work with their health care providers to carefully consider the risks and possible consequences of travel to areas with risk of Zika. If you travel, you should strictly follow steps to minimise exposure to and prevent mosquito bites. '' 
The ICMR adds that Zika virus strain isolated in Rajasthan matches with the one in Brazil, which saw a massive outbreak in 2016. It further clarifies that though preliminary studies done on strain in Rajasthan do suggest that the mutation causing birth defects ( microcephaly ) was absent there but `` further characterisation of the strain is required as microcephaly has several attributable cases. 
This is a quite a departure from the stand taken by ICMR earlier. It had almost ruled out the possibility of microcephaly in Rajasthan. It was also questioned by several experts, who had termed it detrimental to public health. 
Also, the ICMR announced that a study was being rolled out in Madhya Pradesh among Zika-positive pregnant women to understand the outcomes of pregnancy and to know the occurrence of neurological complications, including microcephaly. A similar study, ICMR said, has been rolled out in Rajasthan as well. 
Down To Earth had reported earlier that Zika-positive pregnant women were made to forcefully abort foetuses by government doctors.

KUWAIT: It's business as usual at the bird market in Rai after a recent bird flu scare resulted in authorities closing down the market and culling all the birds displayed for sale. `` We were permitted to sell birds again after over a month of cleaning and sterilizing the market. So far, we are selling just like before, '' said a shop owner at the pet market. Asked if the government compensated them for the lost revenue, he said despite promises, they have n't received any damages yet. `` In our shop, my loss is more than KD 10,000. Shop owners who sell larger birds have told me their losses are almost KD 20,000, '' the owner told Kuwait Times. 
On Feb 5, the Municipality, with the help of the health ministry and the Public Authority for Agricultural Affairs and Fish Resources ( PAAAFR ), forcibly closed all shops at the pet market and destroyed scores of birds to prevent the potential spread of bird flu. The birds were culled en masse and taken to an undisclosed location to be incinerated. During the operation, customers were turned away and municipal trucks and police cars were on standby. 
Avian influenza ( H5N1 ), informally known as bird flu, is a viral infection that can infect not only birds, but also humans and other animals. However, most forms of the virus are restricted to birds. Kuwait last suffered a major outbreak of bird flu in 2007. On Feb 132007, PAAAFR reported the initial outbreak of H5N1 originated in poultry in Wafra. Subsequently, 131 influenza virus infected poultry were confirmed from 20 farms throughout the country. 
The disease resulted in high mortality rates among infected flocks, especially in commercial broiler farms in Wafra and among poultry raised in privately owned residential homes and backyard farms. Disease control measures were implemented starting from Feb 18, 2007, including control of poultry movement, vaccination, disinfection of infected premises and culling of 500,000 birds. The final case of subtype H5N1 was detected on April 20, 2007, and all restrictions were lifted on May 12, 2007. Kuwait was declared free of highly pathogenic avian influenza on July 21, 2007.

Aurangabad, Maharashtra, Feb 24 ( UNI ) Over 200 migratory ` shank ' birds of red and green variety, were found dead in a lake at Gandheli near here in Central Maharashtra even as the animal husbandry department ruled out any symptoms of bird flu in them. A post-mortem report, conducted by the Animal Husbandry department ( AHD ), has revealed that the birds died of pneumonia, AHD Deputy Commissioner J M Doiphode said adding '' no symptoms of bird flu were found in the migratory birds. '' However, samples of their viscera have been sent to the disease investigation section of the state government laboratory at Aundh in Pune and Bhopal-based High Security Animal Disease Laboratory, he said. A sample of live bird is also being sent to the Bhopal laboratory, Mr Doiphode added. The AHD team has also collected water samples to verify the doubts whether the birds died of contaminated water, he said. The birds have been dying for the last few days and the Animal Husbandry department ( AHD ) team rushed the spot last evening when an alert villager informed them about the deaths, officials said. The officials also said these birds, normally found in the hilly Ladakh region as well as in Europe, mights have died over a period of a week or so. When contacted, ornithologist Dilip Yardi, who had visited the Gandheli lake today attributed the deaths of the birds to a suspected ` poisoning '. Meanwhile, Nisarg Mitra Mandal Aurangabad founder president Prof Vijay Diwan ruled out a possibility of ` bird-flu ' behind the deaths of the migratory birds. '' Many of the other birds were found completely fine near the lake, which indicates that there is no possibility of bird flu, '' Mr Diwan argued. According to him, the delay in departure of these migratory birds may be one of the reason of their deaths. Since the mercury has been rising in the region now, the birds might have died of high temperature, he said. He also said, of these two varities, red shanks migrate to India mainly from Europe and green shanks from Tibet as well as Ladakh, after an acute cold followed by a snow-fall there. These birds find the Indian winter climate more suitable. However, they usually start their return journey before summer, he added. Meanwhile, a four member team of ornithologists from the city rushed the lake to take stock of the situation. The team is expected to collect water samples separately. UNI MPJ GK YA RK1726

Flu shows more signs of decline in Northern Hemisphere. 
Flu activity in most of the Northern Hemisphere is declining, with influenza A viruses still predominanting, the World Health Organization ( WHO ) said today in an update that covers data to Mar 17. In North America, the H3N2 strain is dominant, with very few influenza B viruses detected, which is unusual for the latter part of the Northern Hemisphere flu season. In Europe, flu is at baseline or low intensity in 34 countries, with activity still reported as medium in 13 countries. Flu activity in western Asia saw an overall decrease, but levels are still elevated in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. In East Asia, flu showed signs of decline but is still above seasonal thresholds in China and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, South Korea is experiencing a second wave of flu activity caused by H3N2 and influenza B, following earlier activity from 2009 H1N1. In Southeast Asia, flu activity is still elevated in Thailand, with influenza B most frequently detected. In the Southern Hemisphere, flu is still at interseasonal levels, except for some parts of Australia that have been experiencing activity over the past several weeks. Apr 1 WHO global flu update Flu vaccine tied to lower mortality in heart failure patients. 
In a study today in Open Forum Infectious Diseases, researchers combed through published data on all-cause mortality rates among heart failure patients who received the influenza vaccine and found that flu vaccination was associated with a 31 % decreased risk of all-cause mortality in those patients. The effect was more prominent ( 51 % lower risk ) during influenza season. The authors drew from eight studies published since 2000, which included a total of 82,354 patients ( average age of 65 ) with heart failure. They found that patients who had received seasonal flu vaccine had a reduced risk of all-cause mortality ( hazard ratio [ HR ], 0.69; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 0.51 to 0.87 ), especially during flu season ( HR, 0.49; 95 % CI, 0.30 to 0.69 ). `` There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of hospitalization among vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients with heart failure ( pooled hazard ratio of 0.62 favoring influenza vaccination ), which may be due to the relatively limited number of studies, '' the authors wrote. Influenza infection has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and an exacerbation of chronic cardiovascular conditions. Because of this and the evidence gained from this study, the authors recommend seasonal flu vaccines for eligible heart failure patients. Apr 2 Open Forum Infect Dis study High-path avian flu outbreaks strike birds in China, Nepal, Taiwan, Mexico. 
In the latest highly pathogenic avian flu events, China and Nepal reported H5N1 outbreaks in poultry, Taiwan reported more H5N2 on farms, and Mexico reported an H7N3 outbreak in backyard birds, according to World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ) reports and other official notifications. China's H5N1 outbreak occurred at a poultry farm in Xinmin City in Liaoning province, located in the northeast, according to an agriculture ministry statement translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary ( AFD ), an infectious disease news blog. The event killed 1,000 of 24,500 birds, and the rest were culled to control the spread of the virus. The H5N1 event marks the second recent avian flu outbreak in Liaoning province, which recently reported highly pathogenic H7N9 in peacocks at a zoo in the city of Jinzhou. In Nepal, the agriculture ministry reported two more H5N1 outbreaks, both at layer farms in Koshi zone in the southeast. The outbreaks, the second and third reported from Nepal since the middle of March, began on Mar 18 and Mar 21, and between the two locations, the virus killed 3,192 of 5,978 birds. The surviving poultry were destroyed. Taiwan reported more highly pathogenic H5N2 in poultry and in a wild bird, part of activity involving that strain that began in 2015. Of four new poultry outbreaks, all occurred in Taipei City, three involving dead chickens found discarded in nature parks. The fourth outbreak was at a slaughterhouse. Forty-seven of 108 poultry died in the outbreaks. Health officials have stepped up surveillance of poultry farms in the area. In a separate report, Taiwan also reported an H5N2 detection in a grey heron found dead on Mar 30 in Taipei City. In Mexico, animal health officials reported a highly pathogenic H7N3 outbreak in backyard birds in Acolman, located in the greater Mexico City area. The event began on Mar 6, killing all 150 birds at the location. The outbreak is now considered resolved. The country's last H7N3 outbreak occurred in April 2018.

After laboratory testing, a novel avian influenza virus was identified. 
Shortly after the initial investigation, additional household contacts with no direct contact with chickens began reporting similar signs and symptoms, suggesting possible human-to-human transmission. By the middle of March, additional reports of the novel Avian influenza are reported throughout Kansas. This included a confirmed outbreak at a local school and a long-term care facility. In the Kansas scenario, several influenza hospitalizations and 4 deaths were attributed to influenza had been reported. 
As of March 21, the highly contagious, novel virus was being reported by facilities and clinics across Eastern Colorado. Unusually high patient counts from all health care sectors. 
For the purpose of the exercise, the hospital in Sedgwick County was full and they received 15 patients in varying stages of illness. including a family of 5, and one pregnant woman. Overall, the region had 200 patients to care for, and to make matters worse, there was a blizzard in Denver and only one doctor was on call. 
Ambulance personnel, alerted to the mock exercise, were called in to assist with patient care or to take transports as well as helicopters. 
As the scenario played out over the four-hour exercise, the virtual exercise was charted on paper. Afterwards, a debriefing was held to determine what worked, what did n't, and what could have been done better or different.";"EN";2019-04-03 19:43:19;"1 6";

Officials with the National Health Commission in China have reported the first human case of avian influenza A ( H7N9 ) this year in Gansu. 
The male patient from Jiuquan, aged 82, has been hospitalized and is in serious condition. 
Since March 2013, there were a total of 1568 human cases of avian influenza A ( H7N9 ) reported globally ( in the past six waves ).

Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans may range from flu-like symptoms ( e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches ) to severe respiratory illness ( e.g. chest infection ). Eye infection ( conjunctivitis ) and gastrointestinal symptoms ( e.g. nausea, vomiting and diarrhea ) have also been reported. 
The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry ( live or dead ) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments ( such as wet markets and live poultry markets ). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. 
The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.

Saudi Arabia records 2 more MERS cases in Khafji, 7 total in that city. 
Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health ( MOH ) today reported two more MERS-CoV cases in Khafji, more evidence suggesting the city may be the site of a household or healthcare cluster. These are the sixth and seventh cases reported in Khafji since Mar 29. The patients, as with the previous five, are both men, one of whom was a 60-year-old who died from his MERS-CoV ( Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ) infection, the MOH said in an update to its epidemiologic week 14 report. The other patient is 74 years old. The source of the men's infections is not known at this time. Khafji is in northeastern Saudi Arabia near the Kuwaiti border. The new cases raise the country's MERS total for the year to 121 infections, which includes 57 linked to a large outbreak in Wadi ad-Dawasir. Apr 5 MOH update China reports first H7N9 avian flu illness of 2019China has reported its first human H7N9 avian influenza case of the year, in an 82-year-old man from Gansu province, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection ( CHP ) said today, based on information it received from the mainland's National Health Commission. The patient is hospitalized in serious condition. The report did n't say how the man was exposed, but people sickened by H7N9 often have a history of contact with poultry or exposure to poultry environments, such as live-poultry markets. Gansu province is located in northwestern China. In China, the 2017 launch of a poultry vaccine against H5 and H7 viruses has been tied to a steep decline in poultry outbreaks and resulting infections in humans, but sporadic detections continue to occur. The country reported its last human H7N9 infection in February 2018 in a man from Guangdong province. Apr 5 CHP statement Polio case confirmed in Afghanistan as WHO group discusses eradication. 
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ) today in its weekly update said Afghanistan has reported one more wild poliovirus type 1 ( WPV ) case, which occurred in Shahid-e-Hassas district in Uruzgan province, located in the central part of the country. Paralysis onset occurred on Feb 25. Afghanistan has now reported three WPV1 cases for 2019. The country reported no new environmental samples positive for poliovirus.

Apr 7, 2019 - The Department of Livestock Services is preparing to send samples of dead crows and chickens to Australia for genome sequencing to confirm if there has been any change in the biology of the H5N1 virus. 
As a member of the World Organisation of Animal Health, Nepal has to send samples for avian flu of H5N1 for genome sequencing, according to Dr Samjhana Kumari Shakya, deputy director general at the department. 
`` We do not have genome sequencing facility in our laboratory, '' Dr Shakya said. `` So we are sending the samples to a laboratory in Australia. '' 
She informed that over 350 crows died of the H5N1 virus in recent weeks in the city. Samples of the dead crows were examined at the Central Veterinary Laboratory, which confirmed that the virus was responsible for their deaths. 
Rapid response teams deployed from the Department of Livestock Services have also culled over 100,000 chickens in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Makwanpur, Kaski, Morang and Sunsari, following the confirmation of the virus in the last few weeks. 
The department said it had intensified surveillance to prevent the transfer of chickens from virus-hit areas to other places. 
In 2013, thousands of chickens were culled in various districts following the outbreak of the deadly virus.

Kathmandu, April 7 
An outbreak of bird flu has been confirmed in Kathmandu, but doctors have asked people not to panic as the virus is of low risk to humans. 

Around 350 crows found dead in Lainchaur and Durbar Marg areas have tested positive for H5N1 strain of the disease, according to the Department of Livestock Services. The birds were found dead in the third week of March. 
Similar strain of virus was found in different birds, including chicken, last year as well. `` But this is the first time such a large number of dead crows had tested positive for H5N1 strain of the disease, '' said DoLS Director General Bimal Kumar Nirmal. 
People need not worry much about the outbreak of disease, as it does not generally kill people, according to Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, coordinator of Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital at Teku. Bird flu also does not pose food safety risk to humans if meat and eggs infected with the disease are cooked at 70 degree Celsius before consuming. 
It, however, may pose severe health problems to humans if the disease is not diagnosed and treated on time, Dr Pun said. 
Humans can contract H5N1 virus from saliva, excretion and feathers of the infected birds. `` So, stay away from dead birds, '' said Nirmal. `` If dead birds have to be picked up put on gloves, masks and other protective gears and inform authorities about dead birds. '' 
The detection of the bird flu virus in crows has worried many as this type of bird, unlike chicken, can fly, spreading the disease to other animals and even humans. Doctors have, thus, warned people to keep their pets, such as dogs and cats, away from dead birds. 
`` The dead birds may also fall into drinking water sources, contaminating them, '' said Nirmal, requesting people to report these cases to authorities as soon as possible. Some of the symptoms of the disease, also referred to as avian influenza, are sore and aching throats, high evening fever, and reddening of eyes. Regular medication can keep the disease under control. 
`` The virus, however, can not be eradicated once it is transmitted to humans. We can only control the virus from replicating to keep the disease under control, '' said Dr Pun. 
Nepal has been witnessing bird flu outbreaks since 2009. But most of the time this disease was seen in chicken. This year too chickens raised in places like Bhaktapur and Tarkeshwor Municipality were culled after they tested positive for H5N1 strain. 
But on March 17, dead crows were spotted on the premises of Narayanhiti Palace Museum in Durbar Marg and British Council in Lainchaur. The DoLS, on March 21, confirmed that the dead crows were infected with the H5N1 strain of virus. `` Crows are very vulnerable to the disease and die within a day of being infected, '' said Nirmal, adding, `` The outbreak is now under control.

An outbreak of a highly contagious bird flu strain has caused the UAE to ban live birds from the Mexican district of Acolman. The UAE made the decision following a notification from the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases regarding the outbreak of a highly contagious strain of bird flu in the Mexican district of Acolman, and precautionary measures have been put in place to ensure strains of bird flu virus do n't reach the UAE. The MOCCAE has banned the import of all kinds of live domestic and wild birds from the district. 
The UAE is taking important measures. 
Along with checking documentation and country of origin of food products being shipped to the country and conducting sensory detection to ensure the quality of the products comply with the UAE's stringent standards, The UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment ( MOCCAE ) also announced the following precautionary measures: Banned the import of all species of domestic and wild live birds, ornamental birds, chicks, hatching and table eggs, poultry meat, and their non-heat-treated by-products and waste from Mexico, until the outbreak is brought under control. Banned the import of non-thermally-treated poultry products ( meat and eggs ) from the affected Acolman district in Mexico. However, thermally-treated poultry products ( meat and eggs ) have been cleared for import from Mexico. `` We are confident such efforts will mitigate the impact of the bird flu on the UAE's poultry health and safety, in addition to protecting public health and well-being.

New reports over rising bird flu incidents are leaving Nepali livestock officials sleepless! 
Alarmed at the rising rate of H5NI bird flu in Kathmandu, Nepal's Livestock Department is preparing for serious measures to tackle the growing menace. 
The Department has decided to send the samples of dead crows and chickens to Australia for genome sequencing, to confirm the occurrence of the disease and identify possible changes in the biology of the virus. 

To tackle the spreading flu, the department has been holding strict surveillance to prevent the transporting of chicken from virus-hit areas to other places.

The Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) yesterday raised its travel warning for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to the `` alert '' level after China confirmed the world's first case of influenza virus A subtype H7N9 in a human this year. The Chinese government on Friday last week informed the centers that a case of H7N9 avian influenza in a human was confirmed in Jiuquan, Gansu Province, CDC Epidemic Intelligence Center Director Liu Ting-ping ( 劉定萍 ) said. The patient, an 82-year-old man who began exhibiting symptoms on March 18 and was hospitalized on Sunday last week, was confirmed to be infected with the virus, she said. The man's history of exposure to animals was unknown, but he was reportedly likely to have come into contact with animals in Inner Mongolia's Alxa League area, she added. The travel warning was raised to the `` alert '' level due to the confirmation of the novel infection, Liu said. Most cases of H7N9 avian influenza in humans are transmitted from birds to humans, with human-to-human transmissions being rare, CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo ( 羅一鈞 ) said. The early symptoms of H7N9 infection are a fever, coughing, a headache, sore muscles, chills and fatigue, he said, adding that in serious cases, patients might develop pneumonia about three to seven days after the onset of symptoms. Serious cases with pneumonia can also rapidly develop into respiratory failure, septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Lo said, adding that the mortality rate of H7N9 avian influenza infection is as high as 30 to 40 percent. Three H7N9 avian influenza infections, including one death, were confirmed in the previous flu season and all three cases were in China, he said, but added that the tally was a significant reduction from previous years. 
A total of 1,568 H7N9 avian influenza infections have been reported worldwide since 2013, including 615 deaths, and 98 percent of the cases were in China, Lo said, adding that five accumulated cases, including two deaths, were confirmed in Taiwan, and were all imported from China. In addition to Inner Mongolia, the CDC has also issued a travel `` alert '' for novel influenza A infections in eight Chinese cities and provinces, with a `` watch '' warning issued for other areas of the country. The CDC urged people traveling to China to avoid eating raw eggs and poultry; avoid feeding or touching wild birds or poultry; wash their hands frequently with soap; get vaccinated against avian influenza if they need to work with poultry for long periods of time; wear a surgical mask; and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms occur.";"EN";2019-04-09 14:00:45;"1 6";

Avian influenza virus sometimes infect poultry and other birds resulting in outbreaks. Avian influenza is usually rare in humans but sometimes it passes to human and other species due to close contact with the infected bird. The common virus which can infect humans are A ( H5N1 ) and A ( H7N9 ). Avian flu viruses are characterized into two high pathogenicity or low pathogenicity. 
The risk of transmission of avian flu is in those people who work in poultry, travel to virus infected countries, contact with infected bird and by eating raw or under cooked meat or eggs. The A ( H5N1 ) virus subtype, is highly pathogenic, the first infection in humans of this virus was reported in 1997 in Hong Kong. After that the virus has spread to Asia, Europe and Africa and have affected many countries on large-scale, causing millions of poultry infections, several hundred human cases, and many human deaths.

Global avian flu treatment market is expected to witness healthy CAGR over the forecast period due to increase in awareness and diagnosis of avian flu. Increasing burden of avian flu on healthcare systems of endemic region such as Southeast Asia, China will lead to more stringent preventive measures in these regions. Treatment with the antiviral medications such as oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) or zanamivir ( Relenza ) should be started immediately to stop disease progression. 
Also, it is being reported that the antiviral medicines amantadine and rimantadine should not be used in the case of an H5N1 outbreak occurs due to antiviral resistance. Authorities such as WHO, the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ), and the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) are collaborating to assess and address the risk of avian flu 
These avian flu outbreaks in poultry have seriously impacted livelihoods, the economy and international trade in affected countries. The A ( H7N9 ) virus subtype, is very rare and is of a low pathogenicity and its cases are reported only in China. Avian flu symptoms depends of type of virus subtype infection. Preliminary symptoms of A ( H5N1 ) virus include high fever, cough, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, runny nose, muscle ache. Also, lower respiratory tract problems emerge early in patients. 
Avian Flu Treatment Market: Drivers and Restraints: Infection of avian flu virus is suspected and diagnosed on the basis of clinical representation, history of contact with infected case or a positive laboratory test. Thus, awareness will lead to better diagnosis, which in turn will drive the avian flu market. Avian flu pandemic at any point of time can drive the market in the future since the influenza virus different rates in different places such as in 2014, H5N8, a highly infectious subtype of avian influenza, caused disease outbreaks in poultry, starting from South Korea, followed by Asia, Europe, and North America. Also, the various guidelines and recommendation from government authorities will lead to better diagnosis and treatment. However, resistance to existing antivirals can negatively impact the sales of antiviral drugs since it will lead to changes in treatment guidelines. Avian Flu Treatment Market: Regional Overview: Region wise, the global avian flu treatment marketis classified into seven regions namely, North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific, Japan, Middle East and Africa. North America has conventionally dominated the global market for avian flu treatment market due to heightened awareness and good reimbursement policies.

Rather than pointing fingers, the authorities should look more closely at the problems 
Through 2018, there was continuous over-supply of day-old poultry chicks, broilers, and eggs in Bangladesh. The over-supply caused low prices, which made consumers happy, but all local poultry farmers suffered financially. By comparison, in 2019, prices of poultry in local markets have increased. This has brought with it the usual allegations of cartels and price-fixing in the media and from various government bodies. However, to understand the real situation, we have to see the realities of disease and vaccination in the poultry farms of the country. In Bangladesh, due to repeated huge losses since 2009 due to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza ( HPAI, commonly known as `` bird flu '' ), the government has allowed import of HPAI vaccines to protect poultry flocks. The import of HPAI vaccine was allowed as the government was primarily trying to prevent possibly serious transmission of HPAI/bird flu to humans. However, most people outside the poultry industry are not aware that there is a less dangerous variant of the HPAI/bird flu virus, namely Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza ( LPAI for short ). Unlike HPAI, this does not present a public health risk to humans; it only results in sickness and affects the mortality of chicken flocks. The Bangladesh government never allowed import of LPAI vaccines for poultry. Instead, the government directed poultry farmers to control losses from LPAI by increasing bio-security of poultry farms. This can indeed be done, but requires considerable investment such as automatic feeding and drinking machinery, as well as shower facilities for workers. However, the chicken and egg shortage that we are now seeing is the result of not allowing LPAI vaccines. Because most poultry farmers in Bangladesh usually have small farms of only 1,000 or so chickens, they are unable to invest in bio-security measures. As a result, in the winter influenza season, farmers face almost universal losses of poultry due to LPAI infection. In the winter, there is less sunlight and less ultra-violet radiation, which naturally kills influenza viruses in the environment. Thus, winter months are flu season for both humans and poultry. The prevalence of LPAI infections and mortality in poultry flocks changed the chicken and egg over-supply of 2018 to a shortage in 2019 over the course of the winter flu season. It is obvious to everyone in the poultry industry that the current shortage of eggs and chicken can not be resolved by regulation of prices, which is the tempting quick fix that government agencies are drawn to. The real fix is to allow import of LPAI vaccines, and thus help stabilize the supply of chicken and eggs to the consumer. If the supply can be ensured by better vaccination, then prices will automatically be stabilized. Rather than pointing fingers at the poultry industry and accuse it of cartels and price fixing, the government should take the time to look in-depth at the disease problems. It should help the industry to solve these problems with an appropriate vaccination policy. Zeeshan Hasan is a director of Kazi Media, the company behind Deepto TV.

Deadly flu outbreak strikes remote Laotian tribe. 
An outbreak of 2009 H1N1 seasonal flu in a remote indigenous hill tribe in Laos killed 16 people and triggered a quick response from local health officials in Thailand, according to a report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), which also assisted. The outbreak in Phongsaly Province occurred in December and January and came to the attention of public health officials because of its high death rate. Authorities quickly sent antiviral drugs and provided health education and hygiene and sanitization interventions to slow the spread of the outbreak. As part of the response, the CDC regional flu program in Thailand worked with Thailand's health ministry to send an emergency supply of oseltamivir from Thailand to Laos in less 24 hours. Health officials also redirected flu vaccine from Laos ' ongoing seasonal flu campaign to the tribe, enabling more than 2,200 people to be vaccinated and achieving a 74 % vaccination rate. The CDC said no new deaths have been reported, and the epidemic curve shows a decline. An investigation is underway into why the 2009 H1N1 outbreak was so deadly. However, the CDC added that rural, remote populations are often not vaccinated against seasonal flu and typically have little access to healthcare. Malnourishment and underlying medical conditions are additional risk factors, it said. The CDC said close connections between animals and people in rural Laos raise the risk of flu viruses spreading among people and animals, conditions that can give rise to novel flu viruses. It added that a cooperative agreement between the CDC and Laos has improved the country's ability to respond to flu threats and immunize people against seasonal flu. `` Due to this relationship, Laos was the first lower-middle income country to establish its own sustainable influenza vaccination program, '' it said. Mar 6 CDC international program highlight H5 outbreaks strike poultry in Bhutan and Bulgaria. 
In the latest highly pathogenic avian flu developments in poultry, Bhutan reported an outbreak involving H5N1 and Bulgaria reported three more outbreaks from H5N8, according to separate reports from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). Bhutan's outbreak, its first since August 2018, struck backyard birds in Chhukha district in the country's southwest. The outbreak's location is close to the Indian border town of Jaigoan in Bengal state. The event began on Apr 6, killing 264 of 2,000 susceptible birds. The remaining ones were culled, as were 2,000 more thought to be at high risk of infection. So far, the source of the virus has n't been determined. Elsewhere, Bulgaria's latest H5N8 outbreaks occurred in Plovdiv province in the south central part of the country, with start dates ranging from Apr 4 to Apr 8. One involved backyard birds and two occurred on poultry farms. Taken together, the virus killed 635 of 203,787 birds.

One of the major problems poultry farmers face is bird flu ( Avian Influenza or HPAI H5 ). This is a viral disease that affects wild birds, captive wild birds and domestic poultry, including backyard chickens, according to Dr Samuel Nsubuga, a veterinary doctor affiliated to Smart Agribusiness Forum Africa. Bird flu if not attended to immediately, can sweep the whole farm. However, there are two forms of avian influenza, that is low pathogenicity ( LPAI ) and high pathogenicity ( HPAI ). Of the two, the most common one is low pathogenicity avian influenza. Nsubuga says it is mostly harmless and the infected chicken will react with general flu and cold-like symptoms. Highly pathogenicity avian influenza is extremely contagious and kills approximately 90 per cent of all birds ( chickens ) that catch the disease. How it spreads. 
According to the veterinary doctor, birds contract the virus via contact with nasal secretions or faeces from an infected bird. The virus can also spread through; poor biosecurity ventilation in the poultry house, lack of knowledge about bird management, free entrance to outside wild birds, movement of manure in which it can stay for up to 100 days, clothing and shoes of people who visit the bird houses, movement of infected flock into non-infected flock and sharing of equipment and shelter between infected and non-infected birds. Symptoms. 
There are different ways in which bird flu manifests in a poultry house, according to Nsubuga. It however calls for farmers to always be keen, so as to take immediate action. The symptoms may include the following among others, respiratory symptoms, behavioural changes, low egg production, physical signs, gastrointestinal symptoms. Respiratory symptoms. 
Influenza is a respiratory virus, so birds and poultry with bird flu may exhibit respiratory symptoms such as coughing and wheezing. There may also be nasal discharge, in some cases tinged with blood, according to the veteterinary doctor. Behavioural changes. 
Nsubuga says birds with avian influenza often behave differently than before they get infected. For example, they may seem depressed or be inactive. They tend to eat and drink less than normally. The expert adds that the birds may also suddenly seem uncoordinated and become unable to stand or walk normally. Treatment. 
Although the virus is very contagious, Nsubuga says that it can be treated as long as the farmer identifies the situation quickly. The treatment for the virus include antiviral medication which often requires intensive supportive care. However, he advises that the treatment be carried out by a professional veterinary personnel. `` Farmers should avoid trials and testing of treatment doses they are not sure of, as these can result into killing of birds or even misuse of drugs and vaccines, '' he cautions. Dr Nsubuga also gives supplements inform of natural herbs a farmer can give birds as treatment for the virus. Aloevera: This is locally known as kigajji. With this, he says that cut pieces of fresh aloevera leaves and put them in drinking water and let the birds drink it. Red pepper: It is known as pilipili or kamulali. Crush these and infuse them into drinking water. Make the birds drink this concoction as this targets their breath problems and respiratory symptoms. However, some of the control measures which can be used to avoid the cases of bird flu include; vaccinating uninfected birds. This renders the virus harmless thus avoiding cases in vaccinated birds. Vaccination also improves immunity and body defence towards influenza virus. In this case, a farmer has to vaccinate the birds before cases break out. Separate the infected birds from the healthy ones to avoid contact. These should be put far away from the poultry house which contain health birds. Egg production. 
If they have stared laying eggs the time they get infected, the infected egg-laying birds often produce fewer eggs than before. In addition, the egg shells also tend to be soft or with a ram shackled shape ( misshaped ). Physical signs. 
Birds start ruffling of the feathers, the colour of the combs and waddles on the birds turn to bluish-purple. `` Swelling is visible in the combs, waddles, hocks, eyelids and the head, '' Nsubuga says. Gastrointestinal symptoms. 
These appear inside or within the stomach, in the internal parts of the bird. Diarrhoea may develop in some birds with avian influenza. The other symptoms that may indicate that your poultry farm has been attacked may include; sudden death without any signs, lack of coordination, lack of energy and appetite, nasal discharge, decreased egg production, coughing, sneezing, bird dozing, poor breathing, low appetite and general weak appearance.";"EN";2019-04-13 04:02:42;"1 6";

A bird flu ( H5N1 ) outbreak has affected 13 poultry farms and one turkey farm at Dhamdara in Phuentsholing. 
The outbreak was confirmed on April 8 through laboratory test from National Centre for Animal Health ( NCAH ), Serbithang, Thimphu. 
No human contact was reported. 
In response, a total of 1,130 poultry birds in the affected areas were culled, about 4,002 eggs disposed, 613kgs of feed disposed and 12 chicken coops destroyed. 
The National Incident Command Committee ( NICC ) has activated the Incident Operation Centre ( IOC ) at Thromde Veterinary Hospital in Phuentsholing with the Rapid Response Team ( RRT ) from different ministries and agencies for immediate containment and response to the outbreak. 
A press release from the ministry states, `` As the disease is brought under control at the source of outbreak the public should not panic. The public is also advised to take precautions like washing of hands after handling poultry, chicken and eggs with soap and water. '' 
Program director of NCAH, Dr RB Gurung, the focal person of bird flu said the outbreak was reported in the field on April 6. 
He said the outbreak is under control by about 80 percent yesterday. As the outbreak location was at the outskirt of town, there were not much vehicles plying, which made it easier, he added. 
The response team also created awareness in the community. Vehicles plying out of the demarcated infected and restricted zone are also disinfected. 
Dr RB Gurung said poultry farmers are cautioned to comply farm bio-security measures and not allow visitors into the farms without proper safety measures. 
`` We need to observe the outbreak area for one month, '' Dr RB Gurung said. 
The department of livestock, Chukha dzongkhag livestock sector, department of public health, Royal Bhutan Police, Bhutan Agriculture and Food Regulatory Authority and the Regional Livestock Development Centre Tsimasham and local authorities in Phuentsholing have initiated the response to the H5NI outbreak jointly.

Two new MERS cases reported in Saudi Arabia. 
Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health ( MOH ) reported a new MERS-CoV case over the weekend in an update to its epidemiologic week 15 report. On Apr 13, the MOH noted that a 75-year-old woman from Khafji had contracted MERS-CoV ( Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ) as a secondary case, meaning likely not from another MERS patient. It's unknown if she had camel contact. This is the 11th case reported from that city since Mar 29. Her illness lifts Saudi Arabia's total since the first of the year to 130 cases, including 57 linked to a large outbreak in Wadi ad-Dawasir. Apr 13 MOH update CDC ties pre-cut melon to 93-case multistate Salmonella outbreak. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) announced late last week a Salmonella outbreak tied to pre-cut watermelon, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and fruit medley products sold by Caito Foods LLC of Indianapolis. So far 93 people in nine states have been sickened in the outbreak, caused by Salmonella Carrau. There have been no deaths, but 23 patients have required hospitalization. Illnesses started on dates ranging from Mar 4 to Mar 31, and most of the patients are over the age of 50 -- the median age is 53, with patients ' ages ranging from less than 1 to 93 years. According to an Apr 12 CDC notice, 30 of 39 people interviewed reported eating pre-cut melons bought from grocery stores in the week prior to illness. Four additional people reported eating pre-cut melon outside the home. Ohio has reported the most cases, with 27, followed by Michigan ( 19 ), Indiana ( 18 ), Kentucky ( 16 ), and Illinois ( 5 ). Both Minnesota and Missouri have three cases, and Alaska and Wisconsin have one case each. On Apr 12 Caito recalled products produced at an Indianapolis facility. According to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), `` The products were packaged in clear, plastic clamshell containers and distributed in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. `` Both retailers and consumers are urged to toss the fruit, and Caito has halted production on these types of fruit products until further notice. Apr 12 CDC notice Apr 12 FDA notice H5 avian flu poultry outbreaks strike Iran, Nigeria, and Nepal. 
Three countries reported more highly pathogenic avian flu outbreaks in poultry, with Iran and Nigeria grappling with H5N8 and Nepal with H5N1, according to the latest notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). In Iran, the country's veterinary ministry reported two H5N8 outbreaks, one involving a large flock of village birds in Tehran province and the other affecting a layer farm in East Azarbayejan province. Between the two events, the virus killed 4,278 of 75,000 susceptible birds. Authorities culled the remaining ones to curb the spread of the virus. The outbreaks began on Apr 8 and are now considered resolved. So far, the source of the virus is n't known. Iran reported its last H5N8 outbreak about a month ago. Nigeria reported an H5N8 outbreak at a farm housing cockerels and layers in Edo state in the country's southwest. The event began on Apr 5, killing 250 of 1,500 birds. The surviving ones were destroyed as part of the outbreak response. Nigeria's last H5N8 detection in poultry occurred in late January. And Nepal's agriculture ministry reported another H5N1 outbreak, part of sporadic detections since March. The latest outbreak began on Apr 12 at a layer farm in Bagmati zone, killing 123 of 1,000 birds.

Speakers at a symposium on climate change at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases ( ECCMID ) in Amsterdam yesterday warned that the geographic range of mosquito and tickborne diseases is expanding quickly, fueled by multiple factors, including climate change. The experts predicted that vectorborne disease outbreaks will increase across many parts of Europe over the next few decades, even at previously unaffected higher latitudes and altitudes in Northern Europe, according to an ECCMID news release. They warned that actions are needed to improve surveillance and data sharing and to monitor environmental and climate precursors to outbreaks. Climate change is only one of many factors, which include globalization, socioeconomic development, urbanization, and changes in land use, said Jan Semenza, PhD, MPH, with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Giovanni Rezza, MD, PhD, who directs the department of infectious diseases at the Instituto Superiore di Sanita in Rome, said the stark reality is that longer hot seasons will enlarge the seasonal window for the potential spread of vector-borne outbreak, favoring larger events. `` We must be prepared to deal with these tropical infections. Lessons from recent outbreaks of West Nile virus in North America and chikungunya in the Caribbean and Italy highlight the importance of assessing future vector-borne disease risks and preparing contingencies for future outbreaks. `` The experts noted that the interplay between multiple drivers makes projecting disease burden challenging, but they said climate change has allowed mosquitoes and ticks to adapt, proliferate, and broach new areas, with examples including dengue outbreaks in France and Croatia, malaria in Greece, West Nile fever in southeast Europe, and chikungunya in Italy and France.

Experts warn US is ` going backward ' with measles. 
With the current resurgence of measles two decades after it was eliminated, the United States is going backward with measles, leading US experts are warning. The commentary, by Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health along with other public health leaders, appeared yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine. US officials have confirmed 555 measles cases so far in 2019, and the country is on pace to soon pass 2014 totals to reach the most cases since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. The experts explain that measles is highly contagious -- 90 % of people who are not immune will contract the disease if exposed. And though most suffer a mild week-long illness, a significant proportion of cases are fatal. Measles is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable illness and death around the globe, with 100,000 cases attributed to the virus annually -- but this year has already topped that number globally. Because measles is so contagious, herd immunity, which is achieved by 93 % to 95 % coverage, must be reached to stop transmission. Nearly complete protection is entirely attainable given the highly effective measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. `` Unlike many infectious diseases, measles is a public health problem with a clear scientific solution, '' Fauci said. But resistance to vaccination has resulted in a 31 % increase in the number of measles cases reported globally between 2016 and 2017 -- and the rise will be even greater this year. Fauci and colleagues said, `` If this trend is not reversed, measles may rebound in full force in both the United States and other countries and regions where it had been eliminated. '' They add that promoting measles vaccine is a societal obligation. Apr 17 N Engl J Med commentary Study: Rates of high-grade cervical lesions decline after HPV vaccination. 
Researchers today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports ( MMWR ) published the first-ever estimate of cervical precancers using population data of US women. From 2006 through 2018, detection rates of high-grade cervical lesions ( CIN2 +, with CIN referring to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ) declined from 216,000 cases to 196,000, largely attributed to the use of the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine, they write. The decline was seen in women ages 18 to 24, and 76 % of cases were attributable to nine-valent ( nine-strain ) HPV vaccine types. CIN2 + lesions are the most concerning and can lead to cervical cancer, and scientists use CIN2 + rates to monitor vaccine impact. In 2006 the HPV vaccine was licensed for use in women up the age of 26. Women ages 40 to 64 saw significant increased rates of CIN2 + during the study period than did younger cohorts, who were likely vaccinated with one of two HPV vaccines available for use. In 2016, coverage of more than one dose was 65.1 %, and the recommended three-dose coverage was 43.0 % for girls ages 13 through 17, the authors said. `` In younger age groups, the decline in HPV 16/18-attributable CIN2 +, targeted by the quadrivalent vaccine from 2006 to 2015, also reflects the impact of the U.S. HPV vaccination program, '' the authors said. `` Some of the increases in older age groups could be attributable to use of HPV testing, which is more sensitive than cytology, as part of cervical cancer screening, as has been predicted by modeling studies. '' Apr 19 MMWR study Cambodia reports first H5N6 outbreak; other strains hit birds in 3 countries. 
Cambodia's agriculture ministry today reported the country's first detection of highly pathogenic H5N6 avian flu in poultry, and three other countries -- Bangladesh, Mexico, and Taiwan -- recorded events involving other strains, according to the latest notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). In Cambodia, testing in late March as part of active surveillance found H5N6 in poultry at a live-bird market in Takeo province. Ten of 100 birds tested positive, and the remaining ones were culled to curb the spread of the virus. Other Asian nations have also reported H5N6 in poultry, including China, Laos, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, and Taiwan. H5N6 has also been linked to a limited number of human infections, though so far only in China. Elsewhere, Bangladesh said tests on house crows found dead in Khulna division in the country's southwest tested positive for an H5 strain. The report did n't specify the subtype. The outbreak began on Dec 15, involved 31 birds, and is now considered resolved. In developments involving other strains, Mexico's agriculture ministry reported three H7N3 outbreaks in backyard poultry, two in Jalisco state and one in Mexico state, both in the south central part of the country. The events began on Apr 9, killing 750 of 2,527 susceptible birds collectively. Earlier this month Mexico reported another H7N3 outbreak in backyard poultry in Mexico state. And finally, Taiwan reported two more H5N2 outbreaks, both at poultry slaughterhouses detected during postmortem testing. The outbreaks began on Mar 24 and Mar 26 and are now considered resolved.

Israeli authorities have reported an outbreak of H5N8 bird flu at a turkey farm in the northern region of Hazafon, the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ) said on Thursday, citing a report from Israel's agriculture ministry. The virus infected 350 out of a flock of 13,500 turkeys in Ma'ale Gilboa, the report said. Some 200 birds died of the virus and the rest of the flock was slaughtered, the OIE said. The contagious H5N8 strain has never been detected in humans - but it is entirely possible for a strain to mutate and begin being transmitted between people. However, cases of bird flu were reported in the UK in 2014, with others in Germany, South Korea, China and Japan. Flu is a rapidly mutating virus, hence the numerous strains which have been identified, ranging from H1N1, which caused the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918 which killed an estimated 100 million people, to H7N9, which caused an ongoing epidemic in China. In 2017, H3N2 was dubbed Australian flu because of the problems it caused Down Under, with the flu season the worst in a decade. The strain was deemed to pose a particular risk for pregnant women, the elderly and children. Flu symptoms emerge rapidly and can include a sudden fever, an aching body, feeling tired or exhausted, a dry cough, a sore throat, a headache, difficulty sleeping and a loss of appetite. The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) has identified influenza as posing one of the biggest risks of a global pandemic. Speaking last year, Dr Rima Khabbaz, director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases ( NCEZID ), a division of the US-based Center for Disease Control ( CDC ), told Express.co.uk: `` Influenza is top of the list of threats. `` We are not talking about one virus, but a series of viruses. `` It's a pandemic virus and it's not a question of if, but when there will be another flu pandemic. `` Dr Jonathan Quick, chair of the Global Health Council ( GHC ), described the influenza virus as the most `` diabolical, hardest-to-control and fastest-spreading potential viral killer ''. A flu pandemic without the proper medicine and food supply could cause `` the global economy to collapse '' as millions are people are crippled by the influenza virus. If an outbreak was to spread, 33 million people could be killed in the first 200 days of an outbreak, Dr Quick said. He added: `` Within the ensuing two years, more than 300 million people could perish worldwide. '' A total of 217,000 British tourists visit Israel annually.";"EN";2019-04-25 05:00:00;"1 6";

The spread of the H5N8 strain of the avian flu virus in recent years has lead to the deaths of millions of birds in Europe and Asia as health officials have sought to contain the virus. 
The strain is not known to have infected humans as of yet, but officials are concerned it could have a highly deadly potential if it does. 
In 2016, the World Health Organization warned that the H5N8 virus was `` rapidly spreading in Asia and Europe, causing deaths in wild birds and outbreaks in domestic poultry. '' 
Since then, major outbreaks have been reported across the Middle East and Africa. 
Israeli and Palestinian growers have dealt with sporadic outbreaks of the virus over the years, with hundreds of thousands of birds culled to stop the virus from spreading. 
In 2006, southern Israel's poultry industry was brought nearly to the brink of collapse, growers said, after a number of culls following the discovery of bird flu.";"EN";2019-04-25 14:22:00;"1 6";

2019 - 04 -25 Livestock owners urged to be extra vigilant in disease prevention 

A poultry farmer looking after his birds 

Owners of birds such as poultry and livestock, have been urged to be extra vigilant in caring for their animals, in order to prevent infections. This is because diseases like bird flu and anthrax, are often the result of neglect and inadequate care, as well as failure to take the needed steps to prevent disease outbreaks. 

Dr. Kwadwo Obeng-Wiredu, Deputy Director, Greater Accra Metropolitan Assembly, Ghana Veterinary Service, told the Ghana News Agency that with Anthrax for example, it was hardly possible to have an infection get into a farm, unless an infected animal from elsewhere made contact with an animal on the farm. 

He said farmers had to be vigilant concerning people as well as animals entering their farms, because humans could bring in infections if they may have come into contact with infected animals, whilst foreign animals entering the farms could be infected. 

Dr. Obeng-Wiredu said currently, there had been no reported cases of any animal disease outbreaks, whilst outbreaks in the past had been well-contained. He said whilst these diseases could be transmitted to humans, the country had been fortunate not to have had any human related deaths so far. 

`` We only ask farmers to be observant with the basic security measures we have taught them such as washing their hands after touching birds that do not belong to their farms as well as sick and dead ones, burying dead birds and confining their birds and animals, '' Dr. Obeng Wiredu said. 

He said farmers should wear gloves when handling dead or sick birds and animals, and be continually aware of the need to maintain good practises that minimised the possibility of disease outbreaks. Dr. Obeng-Wiredu touched on rabies and said whilst there was not an outbreak of the disease, isolated cases happened once in a while. 

He said regardless of whether a dog had been vaccinated or not against rabies, a person had to report to a certified veterinarian as soon as possible, after being bitten by a dog. 

Dr. Obeng-Wiredu observed that that administering basic first-aid to a dog bit wound was not at all enough, but necessary. He said it was crucial to consult a qualified veterinarian as soon as possible, in order to ensure that a dog bite victim was safe from rabies infection. 

Once bitten by a rabid animal, there is an incubation period of between ten days to one year, but an average of a few weeks to about two months is typical. 

The rabies virus attacks the central nervous system, right through to the brain and typically results in death. 

Vaccinating dogs against rabies, while confining them, safe and away from stray and unknown dogs, is a key preventive measure in the fight against rabies. 

Humans should also avoid contact with animals, especially dogs that do not belong to them, in order to avoid rabies infection.";"EN";2019-04-25 15:19:54;"1 6";

As part of routine surveillance for H5/H7 avian influenza, H5 low-pathogenic avian influenza ( LPAI ) was detected in a commercial duck breeder flock in Monterey County, Cal., exposing 9,746 birds, according to information the U.S. Department of Agriculture submitted to the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ) on April 24. 
According to the OIE report, partial HA sequencing determined the H5 to be a LPAI virus of North American wild bird lineage, but further characterization is pending virus recovery. There have been no clinical signs of illness or increased mortality on the premises, the report said. 
USDA's Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) and the California Department of Food & Agriculture are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and have implemented enhanced surveillance and testing related to this finding, the OIE report said. 
Two additional commercial poultry premises associated with the initial premises have been quarantined and sampled for avian influenza virus, and the results are pending. 
Control measures applied in the case include movement controls, surveillance and quarantine. 
LPAI viruses typically cause few or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds ' feces and respiratory secretions and spreads primarily through direct contact among healthy and infected birds, according to APHIS. LPAI can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials. 
To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm, APHIS said. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Avian influenza viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough disinfection, organic material must first be cleaned from the environment. 
On the other hand, highly pathogenic avian influenza is a serious disease and requires rapid response because it is highly contagious and often fatal to chickens and turkeys, APHIS said.";"EN";2019-04-25 15:40:01;"1 6";

New case of MERS recorded in Saudi Arabia. 
The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health ( MOH ) today recorded a new case of MERS-CoV in Medina in an epidemiologic week 17 update.A 76-year-old man from Medina was diagnosed as having MERS-CoV ( Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ). The man's case is listed as `` primary, '' meaning he likely did not contract the disease from someone else, and he had recent contact with camels. The case raises Saudi Arabia's MERS-CoV total for the year to 135 cases, including 61 linked to a large outbreak in Wadi ad-Dawasir. Apr 25 MOH report Low-path H5 outbreak reported at California duck farm. 
Routine surveillance testing at a commercial duck breeding facility in California's Monterey County has detected low-pathogenic H5 avian flu, according to a notification yesterday from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). The ducks have n't shown any clinical signs or increased mortality, and surveillance tests were done on Apr 15. The US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) and the California Department of Food and Agriculture are conducting an epidemiologic investigation and have stepped up surveillance and testing as a result of the recent findings, including at two poultry facilities related to the duck farm. Partial genetic sequencing tests on the hemagglutinin of the virus suggest that it is a low-pathogenic virus related the North American wild bird lineage. Further genetic tests are pending virus recovery. The United States had three low-pathogenic avian flu outbreaks in 2018, which included H7N3 in California, H7N1 in Missouri and Texas, and H5N2 in Minnesota. Apr 24 OIE report on low-path H5 in California. 
In other avian flu developments, Israel's agriculture ministry reported a highly pathogenic H5N8 outbreak at a commercial turkey farm in Hazafon in the north central part of the country, according to a separate report from the OIE. The outbreak began on Apr 20, killing 200 of 13,500 birds. The survivors were culled to curb the spread of the virus. An investigation suggests the source is contact with wild species, given that the country is on the migration route of wild birds coming from Africa to Europe. The farm is in an aquaculture area that attracts migratory birds. Elsewhere, the Dominican Republic recently reported seven low-pathogenic H5N2 outbreaks, five on poultry farms and two in backyard birds. The outbreaks began between Dec 30, 2018, and Jan 22. Taken together, the events killed 2,887 of 178,601 susceptible poultry, which included Israeli chicks, layers, and other backyard poultry.

UCLA and Cal State quarantine students, faculty exposed to measles. 
Yesterday the University of California, Los Angeles and California State University, Los Angeles campus announced a quarantine of 280 students and faculty exposed to students who have measles, according to news reports. The news came the same day California officials said 38 people have been confirmed with measles in the state so far this year. Five of those cases are from LA County, including one student each from the two universities. The latest possible exposure to the virus on UCLA's campus took place on Apr 9, officials said. A student with the disease attended classes on Apr 2, 4, and 9. The student at Cal State was reported to have visited the library while contagious. `` We are still awaiting medical records from 119 students and eight faculty members to determine whether they are immune to the measles, '' said UCLA Chancellor Gene Block in a statement. Bock said the quarantine will last up to 48 hours, until proof of immunity is established. Measles has resurged in the United States, with almost 700 cases reported this year -- the most in any year since the virus was eliminated in 2000. Most outbreaks in the US are currently tied to international travel. Apr 25 UCLA statement Apr 25 LA Times story Five countries report new polio cases. 
Multiple countries reporting ongoing polio activity reported new cases this week, including wild poliovirus infections in Afghanistan and Pakistan and vaccine-derived polio cases and positive contacts in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ), and Somalia, according to the latest weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ). In Afghanistan, three wild poliovirus type 1 ( WPV1 ) cases were reported, two from different districts in Hilmand province and one from Uruzgan province. The respective paralysis onset dates were Mar 6, Mar 23, and Mar 20. The new cases lift the country's total for the year to six WPV 1 cases. Meanwhile, the GPEI noted early notification of two WPV1 cases, both from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, one a patient from Bannu district with an Apr 2 paralysis onset and the other from North Waziristan district with an Apr 4 paralysis onset. When the cases are confirmed, the number of cases from Pakistan this year will reach eight. In Africa, Nigeria reported two vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 ( cVDPV2 ) cases, one a patient from Kwara state with a Mar 20 paralysis onset and the other a patient from Niger state with a Mar 18 paralysis onset. The developments lift Nigeria's total for 2019 to seven cases. DRC health officials reported one cVDPV2 case from Kasai state with a paralysis onset of Feb 8, its first of 2019. Also, the country reported two cVDPV2 community isolates, also from Kasai state. The GPEI said with the addition of the Kasai state cases the DRC is now affected by five separate cVDPV2 outbreaks. Elsewhere in Africa, Somalia reported one cVDPV2 case and a related contact from Sool province. The patient had a Mar 15 paralysis onset, and the confirmation of the case marks the country's first cVDPV2 illness for 2019. Apr 26 GPEI weekly update New report covers vaccine platform potential for countermeasure development. 
Over the past several years, vaccine platform technologies have been developed that enable the rapid production of multiple products from a single system, which may help medical countermeasure development evolve away from a less efficient `` one bug one drug '' approach, according to a report released yesterday by Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. The report covers major scientific and policy issues related to vaccine platforms and how they are understood in government, academia, and industry, according to a Center for Health Security news release. Amesh Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the center and leader of team that wrote the report, said, `` platforms have the potential to accelerate the vaccine development timeline and the work in this report will hopefully catalyze the discussion of how the power of platform vaccine technologies can be harnessed as a pandemic tool. '' The report was funded by the Open Philanthropy Project. The group said as pandemic preparedness matures, integrating new vaccine platform technologies into countermeasure development has the potential to impact resilience to both global catastrophic biologic risks and other epidemic threats. They tie in findings from existing evidence, informational interviews, and a workshop held with subject matter experts. And they make five main recommendations that center around platform and nonplatform vaccine technology proliferation; focusing platform-based assessments on accelerating manufacturing rather than speeding regulatory developments; supporting traditional vaccine development; prioritizing mRNA-based vaccines; and giving special consideration to platform technologies, given market conditions. Apr 25 Center for Health Security news release Apr 25 Center for Health Security vaccine platform report High viral loads linked to fatal H5N1 casesA new study in Clinical Infectious Diseases uses nasal and fecal samples to estimate viral loads in human patients with avian influenza H5N1, finding that higher viral loads are linked to fatal cases. The study was based in Indonesia. Since 2005, Indonesia has recorded 200 human infections with clade 2.1 highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus, and the cases have a high case-fatality rate of 84 %. Researchers collected specimens from 180 H5N1 patients between 2007 and 2015, representing 90 % of all Indonesian patients and 20 % of reported H5N1-infected patients globally. They also tested for resistance to oseltamivir, an antiviral drug. Feces and blood had the highest concentrations of H5N1 RNA, and higher viral loads correlated with fatal cases. Genes that conferred resistance to antivirals were also more prevalent in fatal cases. Apr 26 Clin Infect Dis study";"EN";2019-04-26 20:30:00;"1 6";

CDC records 21 more E coli cases in ground beef outbreak, 177 total. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) late last week recorded 21 more cases in an Escherichia coli O103 outbreak linked to ground beef, bringing the outbreak total to 177 illnesses. Ten states have reported illnesses, and 21 patients have been hospitalized. So far, there have been no deaths recorded in this outbreak. Kentucky has the most cases, with 65, followed by Tennessee ( 52 ), and Georgia ( 41 ). Ohio has 10 cases, Florida has 3, Virginia has 2, and Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, and Mississippi have each recorded 1 case. The CDC's outbreak investigation began on Mar 28 in Kentucky and Georgia, the CDC said. On Apr 24, Grant Park Packing of Franklin Park, Illinois, recalled approximately 53,200 pounds of raw ground beef products. The beef was distributed to restaurants. The day before, K2D Foods, doing business as Colorado Premium Foods in Carrolton, Georgia, recalled 113,424 pounds of ground beef. `` Ill people in this outbreak ate ground beef from many sources. Investigators continue to trace other sources for ground beef, and more product contaminated with E. coliO103 may be recalled, '' the CDC said. Illnesses for this outbreak started from Mar 1 to Apr 14, and the median age of case-patients is 18. Fifty-one percent are female. Apr 26 CDC update H5 outbreaks strike again in Nepal, Taiwan, and Mexico. 
Nepal, Taiwan, and Mexico all reported highly pathogenic avian flu outbreaks involving different strains, according to the latest notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). In Nepal, the H5N1 virus struck again at a commercial duck farm in Bagmati zone, which surrounds Kathmandu. The event is part of sporadic outbreaks that have been occurring in the country since March. The new outbreak began on Apr 23, killing 190 of 500 susceptible birds. The survivors were culled to control the spread of the virus. Taiwan reported two more outbreaks involving H5N2, part of activity involving the strain under way since 2015. The latest events began on Apr 8 and Apr 12, both affecting farms that raise native chickens, one in Changhua County and one in Yunlin County. The outbreaks killed 122 of 23,599 poultry, and authorities destroyed the others as part of the response. Elsewhere, Mexico reported two H7N3 outbreaks, one that began on Apr 8 at a large poultry farm in Queretaro state and one that started on Apr 15 in backyard birds in neighboring Hidalgo state. Between the two outbreaks, the virus killed 172 of 139,230 birds. The events mark the third report of H7N3 on Mexican farms since the beginning of April. Apr 27 OIE report on H5N1 in Nepal Apr 26 OIE report on H5N2 in Taiwan Apr 27 OIE report on H7N3 in Mexico Survey highlights child caregiver flu vaccine hesitancy, misperceptionsA survey of children's caregivers about flu vaccine perceptions found that even some whose children have gotten the first of the required two doses for younger children are still hesitant and that many have inaccurate beliefs about the vaccine. Researchers who were part of an American Academy of Pediatrics study presented their findings today at the Pediatric Academic Societies ( PAS ) annual meeting in Baltimore. The focus was caregivers of children who received the first of two required flu vaccine doses. Children ages 6 months to 8 years old need two doses in the same season to be adequately protected, but only half typically receive the second dose. The survey was conducted during the 2017 - 18 season as part of a study to gauge the impact of text message flu vaccine reminders. It included responses from 256 participants from 36 primary care network practices across 24 states. The researchers found that 11.7 % of caregivers had moderate or high vaccine hesitancy. In addition, a high proportion had inaccurate beliefs, such as that flu is just a bad cold ( 40.2 % ), the child will be protected with just one shot ( 93.8 % ), the flu shot causes flu ( 57 % ), and children ca n't die from flu ( 68 % ).

As migratory birds make their way north this spring, few people will look to the sky and think, `` God help us. Here they come. '' 
It has been 101 years since the onset of the Spanish Flu, a virus that may have derived from bird flu that killed 3 to 5 percent of the world's population. Ever since then, the threat that an equally fatal flu might strike has loomed large. 
Now, scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Research Center are digging deep into how the virus jumps from birds to people. The researchers have mapped all the ways that a critical protein in influenza can mutate to make the virus more likely to cross species. 
The new map could help scientists predict which flu strains present the greatest threats and act faster to target those viruses with a vaccine. 
Scientists do n't currently know `` how well a particular virus is going to do in a human host, '' Dr. Shirleen Soh, a postdoctoral fellow at Fred Hutch and lead author on the paper, said in an announcement. 
Soh took a protein in bird flu called PB2 and mutated it, later testing whether the changes caused the flu to grow stronger in human cells. Armed with a list of the most problematic mutations, Soh then realized that only a few of them had ever been recorded in cross-species influenza jumps. 
Soh, who is based in the lab of computational biologist Dr. Jesse Bloom, worked with postdoctoral fellow Dr. Louise Moncla to compare the mutations to those seen in different types of H7N9, a flu strain that first infected people in China six years ago. 
`` We were able to take Shirleen's map and see that many H7N9s that jumped into humans did have evidence of adaptive mutations, including some mutations that we had n't known about before Shirleen's mapping experiment, '' Bloom said. 
The findings could help future scientists figure out which mutations are most likely to move across species. The team hopes to make the data accessible to others by integrating it into Next.

New Ebola cases push DRC total past 1,500 as deaths approach 1,000 The Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) health ministry said today that Ebola infections have been confirmed in 15 more people, 2 of them health workers. All of the cases are from the current known hot spots, including 7 in Katwa. The others are from Musienene ( 3 ), Butembo ( 2 ), Mandima ( 2 ), and Mabalako ( 1 ). The new health worker infections involve people from Katwa and Musienene, pushing the number of healthcare workers sickened in the outbreak to 94, including 33 deaths. The new illnesses push the overall number of cases to 1,510, which includes 1,444 confirmed and 66 probable infections. Health officials are still investigating 286 suspected cases. Ten more people died from their Ebola infections, 7 of them in the community or in hospitals. Three occurred in Ebola treatment centers, two in Butembo and one in Katwa. Total outbreak deaths have now reached 994. May 2 DRC statement Reports from Nepal detail country's first H5N1 case. 
Media outlets from Nepal today, citing the country's health ministry, reported the country's first human H5N1 avian flu case, involving a 21-year-old man who apparently died from his infection. The country has seen sporadic H5N1 outbreaks in poultry since March, most recently at a commercial duck farm in Bagmati zone, which surrounds Kathmandu. The Himalayan Times said the patient is from Kavrepalanchok district in the south central part of the country. He died on Mar 29, and tests the next day revealed H5N1. The samples have been sent to Japan for further testing, according to the report. Nepal's case would mark the world's first confirmed H5N1 case since 2017. Since 2003, the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has reported 860 human H5N1 cases, 454 of them fatal. Egypt, Indonesia, and Vietnam are among the hardest-hit countries. May 2 Himalayan Times story WHO background on H5N1 cases FDA approves Dengvaxia, Sanofi's controversial dengue vaccine. 
Yesterday the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved Dengvaxia, the world's first dengue vaccine, for use in children ages 9 through 16 who have had at least one laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection and live in endemic areas. `` As the second infection with dengue is often much more severe than the first, the FDA's approval of this vaccine will help protect people previously infected with dengue virus from subsequent development of dengue disease, '' said Peter Marks, MD, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a press release. The list of caveats comes after Sanofi Pasteur's vaccine caused public outcry in the Philippines in 2017, when it was discovered the vaccine had been administered to dengue-naive schoolchildren. In some cases, the vaccine can act as a `` priming '' infection in dengue-naive recipients, making subsequent infections severe and life-threatening. The World Health Organization has since recommended the vaccine be administered only to those with evidence of prior dengue infection. Dengvaxia is a live-attenuated vaccine and contains genes of each of the four subtypes of dengue. Dengue is endemic in the US territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. May 1 FDA press release Merck steps up MMR production in wake of US measles outbreaks. 
Merck, the sole provider of a measles vaccine in the United States, said it is stepping up production of the measles, mumps, and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine to meet the demands, but supplies have not yet been outpaced by the growing number of US cases. According to a Reuters story, Merck said earlier this week that US sales of MMR and chickenpox vaccines rose around 10 %, to $ 343 million in the first quarter. As of Apr 26, the United States has recorded 704 measles cases, the most in any year since 1994, and the highest number recorded since the virus was eliminated in 2000. The resurgence has been linked to vaccine hesitancy, close-knit communities, and international measles outbreaks, according to the latest measles report published this week in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports ( MMWR ). `` Among the 704 cases, 503 ( 71 % ) were in unvaccinated persons and 689 ( 98 % ) occurred in U.S. residents. Overall, 66 ( 9 % ) patients were hospitalized, '' the report said. May 1 Reuters story Apr 29 MMWR report WHO: Republic of Congo sees more than 6,000 chikungunya cases. 
The Republic of the Congo in February declared a chikungunya outbreak, and cases have not topped 6,000, according to a WHO statement yesterday. Since Jan 1, officials have reported 6,149 suspected cases of chikungunya in the country, with approximately 54 % of reported cases being reported in women. The WHO warned, however, that the number of cases is likely underestimated. `` The scale of this outbreak has likely been underestimated given the limited detection capacity of the surveillance system in the country. Several mosquito breeding sites in affected areas and inadequate vector control mechanisms also represent major contributing factors for the outbreak, '' the WHO said. So far, no deaths have been reported in any of the eight health departments reporting cases. This is the second chikungunya outbreak in the Congo since 2011, the WHO said, but no seasonal patterns have been detected. May 1 WHO statement";"EN";2019-05-02 19:58:07;"1 6";

Kathmandu, May 2 
A 21-year-old patient infected with Influenza A virus subtype H5N1, popularly known as bird flu, has died in Kathmandu, becoming the first case of bird flu death in Nepal. 

The Ministry of Health and Population organised a press conference today to inform the public about the first case of bird flu death. Government officials said the identity of the victim was being withheld mainly to avoid creating panic among the public. They added there was no need to panic, as it was a month - old case and chances of the virus spreading were remote. 
Pushpa Chaudhary, secretary at the Ministry of Health and Population, told mediapersons today that the ministry had sent the victim's throat swab to WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza in Japan which confirmed bird flu. 
The youth was admitted to a hospital on March 24 with symptoms of fever and cough and died on March 29. The government received a report from Japan only on April 30 that confirmed bird flu. Chaudhary said the government had taken all measures to prevent the virus from spreading to other members of the victim's family and the public. 
According to Chaudhary, doctors suspected that the victim was infected with H5N1 influenza virus and sent his throat swab to National Public Health Laboratory, Teku. 
`` National Public Health Laboratory could not identify the type of influenza, so we sent the sample to WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza ' in Japan, '' said Secretary Chaudhary. 
She said the ministry started comprehensive epidemiological investigation and risk management in coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, WHO South East Asia Regional Office and WHO country office. According to World Health Organisation, H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds. 
Humans are rarely infected with influenza A ( H5N1 ). When people to people infection is caused due to mutation of the virus, which is a rare occurrence, then there is 60 per cent chance of mortality, said Bibek Kumar Lal, executive director at Epidemiology and Diseases Control Division. 
`` On examining the symptoms, we prescribed Oseltamivir, but unfortunately we could not save him, '' Lal said. 
According to Chaudhary, infection of bird flu from birds to humans is rare and from human to human even rarer. Since 2004, 860 people have died of bird flu around the world. 
Lal said government officials called the victim's family immediately after they received the report from Japan and the family informed them about the victim's death. 
The disease was reported in Nepal in March. 
Banshi Sharma, director general of Department of Livestock Services, said bird flu was reported recently in Tarkeswor Municipality, Hetauda, Morang and Sarlahi districts. 
`` We have already culled 100,000 poultry and are still collecting samples of poultry. There is no risk of bird flu in poultry farms, '' he said. 
Cases of H5N1 infection in humans are found to have been caused by close contact with infected live or dead birds or A ( H5N1 ) - contaminated environment. 
Doctors say well-cooked food, particularly the food cooked at 70 degrees Celsius, is devoid of deadly virus. They add that washing hands with soap after touching chickens, maintaining personal hygiene and sanitation and staying away from dead birds and poultry can minimise the risk of bird flu infection. 

Symptoms 

High fever and malaise, cough, sore throat, and muscle ache 
Abdominal pain, chest pain and diarrhoea 
Infection progresses quickly to severe respiratory illness, pneumonia and neurological changes

H5N1 avian influenza/CDC 
According to health officials, the victim was a 21-year-old man from Kavrepalanchok district. 
The Himalayan Times says the individual died on March 29 after having contracted the flu. Laboratory tests, which were received on April 30, was found to be H5N1 influenza positive. The health officials who had diagnosed bird flu as the cause of the patient's death had sent the patient's sample to Japan for further tests. 
According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ), H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza ( or `` bird flu '' ). Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60 %. 
Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual. 
The last reported human H5N1 AI cases were reported in 2017 in Indonesia and Egypt. Prior to this case, since 2003, a total of 860 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A ( H5N1 ) virus, including 454 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 16 countries.

WHO confirms details on Nepal's first H5N1 avian flu case. 
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) office in Nepal yesterday shared more details about the country's first human H5N1 avian flu infection, a fatal case first reported by local media outlets. The 21-year-old man was admitted to a hospital on Mar 24 with a fever and cough, and health workers who suspected he was sick with influenza obtained a throat swab and started him on oseltamivir. He died from respiratory complications on Mar 29. Nepal's National Public Health Laboratory confirmed influenza A and sent the sample to Japan's WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza, which confirmed H5N1 avian influenza as the subtype and sent the notification to Nepalese officials on Apr 30. The WHO said the country has n't reported any further cases. The country's health ministry, teams from the WHO, and livestock officials have launched a detailed investigation,. Nepal has reported sporadic H5N1 outbreaks in poultry since March. Actions are under way to step up surveillance, assess the risk of spread, and share risk communications on prevention steps.

In the single-center study, the researchers studied 342 consecutive leukemia patients treated from September 2011 through August 2017 at LDS hospital in Salt Lake City. The aim of the study was to determine whether a change in empiric therapy for leukemia patients with febrile neutropenia had any impact on the incidence of hospital-acquired VRE colonization. In September 2015, in response to a previous study that found use of a carbapenem for empiric therapy of febrile neutropenia was an independent risk factor for VRE colonization in leukemia patients, the hospital changed the empiric antibiotic from a carbapenem to a cycling regimen of cefepime and piperacillin/tazobactam. Of the 342 patients, 214 were admitted during the carbapenem period and 128 during the cycling period. Weekly surveillance for VRE stool colonization showed that the change in empiric antibiotics was associated with a significant decrease in VRE colonization ( hazard ratio, 0.35; 95 % confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.66 ). In addition, an analysis of representative stool samples found there was a switch in the dominant VRE multilocus sequence types ( from ST664 and ST967 prior to the change to ST186 and ST896 after ) and some changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome. Patients during the carbapenem period also had longer hospital stays and durations of severe neutropenia and 10 % higher hospital costs. `` In conclusion, less carbapenem use was associated with a reduction in VRE colonization, a decreased duration of neutropenia, and a decrease in hospital length of hospital stay, reduced costs, as well as possibly beneficial effects on potentially important gastrointestinal microbiota such as Blautia spp, '' the authors of the study write. May 3 Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol abstract Afghanistan and Pakistan report more polio cases. 
In its latest weekly update, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ) today reported three more wild poliovirus type 1 ( WPV1 ) cases, one from Afghanistan and two from Pakistan. The countries, in addition to Nigeria, are considered endemic for WPV1. Afghanistan's case involves a patient from Nawzad district in Helmand province whose paralysis began on Apr 3, the country's seventh case of 2019. The cases in Pakistan -- which has experienced recent attacks on polio vaccinators and their security teams -- involve patients from two different districts in Khyber Pakthunkhwa province, one with an Apr 2 paralysis onset and the other with an Apr 4 onset. The country has now reported eight WPV1 cases for the year. Also, the GPEI said 11 WPV1-positive samples have been reported by Pakistan over the past week from four provinces: Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakthunkhwa, and Sindh. The samples were collected between Mar 17 and Apr 15. So far, Pakistan has reported 102 positive environmental samples for 2019. May 3 GPEI weekly report NIAID awards $ 30 million to support flu imprinting study. 
Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center said yesterday that it will use a $ 30 million grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ), part of the National Institutes of Health, to fund a cohort study to explore how the immune systems of infants and children are affected by their first exposures to flu viruses. In a statement, the hospital said the study will help answer questions about flu immunity, clarify protection gaps with current vaccines, and assist with efforts to develop a universal flu vaccine that can provide longer-lasting coverage. The study will probe the idea that a person's very first flu exposure guides the magnitude, durability, and breadth of immune response to all future flu exposures. Mary Allen Staat, MD, MPH, principal investigator, said flu vaccine developers need to do better with flu vaccine effectiveness, given that most other vaccines have effectiveness rates above 90 %. `` To achieve that goal, we need much more data from real people. That's what our study will seek to generate. Then, the vaccine makers will have the information they need to make a better, longer-lasting vaccine, '' she added. Called the IMPRINT study, the research will involve 2,000 sets of mothers and infants from the Cincinnati area and Mexico City and weekly medical testing for at least 3 years. Researchers will ask each mother to respond to texts about symptoms and provide weekly nasal swab samples. Teams will also collect blood and other samples to track responses to the vaccine and circulating flu virus exposure. The team includes researchers with systems biology expertise and partners from Emory University. May 2 Cincinnati Children's news release PAHO confirms Mayaro virus cases in Peru, Ecuador. 
Earlier this week the Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO ) reported that both Peru and Ecuador have recorded cases of Mayaro virus ( MAYV ) in 2019. The arbovirus is spread by Haemagogus mosquitoes, and often appears in humans who have recently been exposed to humid forest environments.MAYV causes febrile illness with severe joint edema, rash, headache, and dizziness. The disease is usually self-limiting, though there has been a fatal case of encephalitis caused by MAYV documented in a Haitian child. Two cases have been confirmed in Peru this year, in Quispicanchis and La Mar provinces. In Ecuador, five cases have been detected across a wide swath of the eastern part of the country. `` Outbreaks described in the last decade in the Americas were reported among residents of rural communities in the Amazon region of Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Venezuela. The majority of human cases occurred among persons who work or reside in tropical rainforests, '' PAHO said. May 1 PAHO report";"EN";2019-05-03 20:28:31;"1 6";

Kolkata, May 4 ( UNI ) H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza ( or `` bird flu '' ). 
Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60 per cent. 
Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual.";"EN";2019-05-04 02:16:00;"1 6";

May 5, 2019 - In a hurriedly called press conference on May 2, the Ministry of Health and Population announced that a person had died from bird flu, the first human casualty in Nepal by H5N1 virus. The 21-year-old had died on March 29, according to the ministry. 
It was the first H5N1 human infection in the world since February 2017 and there were immediate concerns whether the virus was making a resurge. But the authorities concerned, it seems, are still too slow to recognise. Nor is there any preparedness to control further infection. 
On Sunday, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division under the Department of Health Services imparted an orientation to doctors and lab technicians to ensure surveillance of bird flu virus. 
The Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital and the National Public Health Laboratory have sent six doctors and four lab technicians respectively at the request of the division for the orientation. These doctors and technicians will carry out surveillance for four days. 
Read: First bird flu death in the country exposes passive surveillance and poor preparedness It is unclear which area and the size of the population they are going to cover during the surveillance. It is also unclear how many people might have come into contact with the person who died. 
`` The government actions suggest our mechanisms are not ready to detect and respond to the disease, '' Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, a virologist, told the Post. `` First and foremost, the authorities must recognise the fact that bird flu is a highly pathogenic disease. '' 
The World Health Organization says H5N1 is a lethal bird flu virus strain that is highly pathogenic, which has a 60 percent fatality rate. 
According to the division, doctors and technicians who took part in the orientation will carry out an epidemiological investigation to find the presence of the virus. 
But experts have questioned whether the move is too little too late. Officials concerned provided little answer to preparedness strategy. 
Health facilities in the country are ill-equipped to handle cases of contagious diseases. 
An isolation centre built at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, with the financial support from World Health Organization, has been lying idle for the last one decade, largely due to lack of manpower and required infrastructure. 
`` Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population has time and again assured that it would provide technical manpower to the centre, but this is yet to materialise, '' said Dr Basudev Pandey, director at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Teku. `` We have neither any dedicated team nor equipment. '' 
According to him, dedicated ambulances, drivers and special training are required to health workers to handle patients infected with contagious diseases like bird flu. 
Moreover, infectious disease control hospital and central laboratory are in the city centre, which could also pose a greater risk as a disease can spread in masses. 
`` The good thing is no one has come in contact with the virus. The incubation period of the virus is one week and there have been no cases of infection even after five weeks, '' said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, said. `` No other patients in the area where the person died -- or elsewhere -- have been diagnosed with the disease as per our laboratory records. '' 
According to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, doctors and technicians, selected for the epidemiological investigation, would now start collecting samples from the hospital where the man died, and from his house. The samples will be secured at the National Public health Laboratory, which will be examined in a WHO reference laboratory abroad to ascertain if the virus still exists or not, said officials at the division. 
Viruses like H5N1 have perplexed scientists for long. There were 469 human infections and 282 deaths across the world between 2003 and 2009, according to the WHO. And between 2012 and 2014, there were 233 human infections and 125 deaths and in 2015, there were 145 human cases and 42 deaths. But in 2016 human cases and deaths were 10 and 3 respectively. 
Similarly, the last time human cases were in 2017 when there were four infections and two deaths. It was not clear why and how H5N1 infections suddenly went down, but there were always concerns that the virus could make a comeback, as viruses do mutate. 
Nepal's first bird flu human case resulting in death has now drawn international attention. 
`` Experts and officials from the World Health Organization headquarters and its Delhi office have arrived in Kathmandu who will assist Nepali doctors and technicians in the surveillance, '' said Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, a spokesperson for the Health Ministry. 
Authorities have not disclosed the details about the deceased. But it is learnt that the 21-year-old man from Kavrepalanchok district was residing in Bhaktapur. 
He was admitted to a Kathmandu hospital for treatment of fever and cough. Doctors at the hospital suspected influenza infection and sent throat swab specimens to the National Public Health Laboratory on March 25. 
The same day, before the laboratory results were out, the patient was administered Oseltamivir, an influenza antiviral medication taken from the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. But the laboratory failed to identify the strain of the virus, according to the Health Ministry. 
Four days later, on March 29, the patient died due to respiratory complications while undergoing treatment. 
The national laboratory then sent the throat swab specimens to the WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza in Japan, which on April 30 confirmed that the cause of the death was H5N1 virus. The ministry made it public two days later. 
The H5N1 bird flu virus was first detected in birds in Nepal in 2009. The country declared itself free from H5N1 in 2012 but this strain of the deadly bird flu virus continues to be found in poultry farms in Nepal. 
According to Dr Bansi Sharma, director general at the Department of Livestock Services, this year alone, 52 samples collected from poultry farms examined by the central veterinary laboratory tested positive for H5N1 virus. 
Following the confirmations, rapid response teams of veterinary technicians were deployed to poultry farms in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Makwanpur, Morang, Sunsari and Kaski districts and over 100,000 infected chickens were culled

Influenza A virus - known for causing `` bird flu '' and `` swine flu '' - can affect both people and animals. The virus is able to jump to new species, where it can cause more severe symptoms. Seasonal epidemic outbreaks cause significant disease and death in people. 

A new study led by Dr Finn Grey of The Roslin Institute aims to identify genes that are important in reducing infection by Influenza A virus in pigs and chickens, and genes that limit the spread of the virus to people. 
A barrier to flu jumps to new species 
Jumps to new species are relatively rare because the virus has to adapt to the new species and because a specific ` arm ' of the immune system -- called the host interferon response -- represents a significant barrier to the virus spreading from animals to people. 
This study will investigate which genes are important for inhibiting replication of Influenza A virus in pigs and chickens and which genes of the host interferon response limit the spread of the virus from animals to people. 
Understanding how to combat influenza 
The study, which will receive over # 750,000 from the UK Governments's Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, will boost our understanding of how to combat influenza strains.

An Iowa egg farm that killed millions of chickens because of a 2015 bird flu outbreak is suing companies hired by the federal government to disinfect barns. 
Sunrise Farms says the chlorine dioxide gas and heat treatments used to kill the virus destroyed barn equipment, electrical wiring, production equipment and water lines. The company also says the structural integrity of its barns was diminished. 

Max Barnett, the CEO of Sunrise Farms ' parent company, South Dakota-based Sonstegard Foods, said he could n't comment on a pending court case. 
The farm is near the northwest Iowa town of Harris, about 225 miles northwest of Des Moines. It includes a feed mill, 25 layer barns, two manure barns and a processing plant. The barns housed 4 million egg-laying hens, and two other buildings had 500,000 young hens being raised to become layers. 
The farm confirmed on April 19, 2015, that its birds had the deadly strain of H5N2 bird flu. Officials from the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service division arrived within days and took over the cleanup and disinfection process, hiring several companies to complete euthanizing birds and disinfecting barns to prevent the spread of the virus. 
In the 2015 U.S. bird flu outbreak, more than 50 million chickens and turkeys died or were destroyed. That comprises about 12 percent of hens that produce eggs people eat and 8 percent of the inventory of turkeys grown for meat, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
About 87 percent of bird losses occurred in Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer, and Minnesota, the top turkey grower. Other cases were reported in Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota. 
The heat treatment used at some of Sunrise Farms barns was designed to raise the temperature to 120 degrees ( 49 degrees Celsius ) for a period of seven days. In other barns the government officials ordered the use of chlorine dioxide, a chemical known to kill the flu virus. 

The barns were declared free of virus and eligible for restocking on Sept. 16, 2015, but court documents say the treatments destroyed equipment, electrical wiring and water lines, and left the barns ' structural integrity diminished. Sunrise Farms claims its property damage required extensive repairs. 
The company filed the lawsuit in March 2018 in federal court in Iowa, seeking to be repaid for the cost of repairs, interest, late charges and the cost of the lawsuit. 
It claims negligence for causing significant property damage and breach of contract, saying the contracted companies `` failed to adequately perform the contract obligations. '' 
The lawsuit names Clean Harbors Environmental Services of Norwell, Massachusetts, and other companies based in Georgia and New York. 
In court documents, Clean Harbors, which applied the chlorine dioxide gas treatment, denied responsibility for the damage and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. The company said Sunrise Farms `` failed to adequately and properly mitigate its damages. '' 
Clean Harbors is suing six other companies that were contracted to assist in the operation. One of those companies is suing seven other companies with which it had contracted. 
A lawyer representing Clean Harbors did n't respond to a message. 
The lawsuit is set for trial on Jan. 27, 2020, in Sioux City. 
Another major egg producer with barns in Iowa and other states also used the heat treatment for disinfection after the bird flu and said he saw some damage but determined the equipment was older and needed to be replaced anyway. 
Marcus Rust, CEO of Rose Acre Farms, the nation's second-largest egg producer, said his company was satisfied with its outcome. 
Rust said he 'd heard about the problems at Sunrise Farms and was uneasy but determined that the effectiveness of the gas treatment was better than any other alternative. 
`` Did we have zero problems? No. But has it been acceptable? Yes. We were apprehensive and maybe we watched it a lot closer because of all the warnings, '' he said.

JOHOR BARU, May 8 -- Four men were fined RM1 ,000 each today by the Magistrates Court here after pleading guilty to transporting 13 chickens into Johor from Kelantan without permission in April last year. 
The Johor government is regulating the import of fowls in a bid to curb the spread of bird flu, and those seeking to bring in chicken, whether dead or alive, must first get written permission from the Johor Veterinary Services Department director. 

Fauzi Yazid, 47, Nik Nurilham Muhamad @ Afandi, 41, Mohd Zulhilmi Amzar Zuhaimi, 27, and Raja Alfaisal Raja Azlan, 27 were accused of violating Paragraph ( a ) of the Johor Avian Influenza Control Area Order 2005, which provides for a fine of up to RM15 ,000, upon conviction. 
According to the charge sheet, the owner of the chickens Nik Nurilham was charged with transferring seven live chickens, while Mohd Zulhilmi was charged with carrying four dead chickens and Raja Alfaisal and Fauzi a live chicken each using an express bus from Kelantan to arrive at Platform B of the Larkin Sentral Terminal here at 11.20 am on April 7, 2018. 
Magistrate Nurasidah A. Rahman also ordered Nik Nurilham, Raja Alfaisal and Fauzi to pay the cost of care and treatment to the Johor Veterinary Services Department. 
Nik Nurilham was ordered to pay RM706 .04 while Raja Alfaisal and Fauzi were ordered to pay RM109 .51 respectively. 
The magistrate said the four will have to spend three weeks in jail if they fail to pay the fine.

Avian influenza ( AI ), generally called bird flu, is an infectious viral disease of birds. I t is generally found in some species of water birds mainly in wild water fowl such as ducks and geese. Avian influenza virus sometimes infect poultry and other birds resulting in outbreaks. Avian influenza is usually rare in humans but sometimes it passes to human and other species due to close contact with the infected bird. The common virus which can infect humans are A ( H5N1 ) and A ( H7N9 ). Avian flu viruses are characterized into two high pathogenicity or low pathogenicity. The risk of transmission of avian flu is in those people who work in poultry, travel to virus infected countries, contact with infected bird and by eating raw or under cooked meat or eggs. The A ( H5N1 ) virus subtype, is highly pathogenic, the first infection in humans of this virus was reported in 1997 in Hong Kong. After that the virus has spread to Asia, Europe and Africa and have affected many countries on large-scale, causing millions of poultry infections, several hundred human cases, and many human deaths. These avian flu outbreaks in poultry have seriously impacted livelihoods, the economy and international trade in affected countries. The A ( H7N9 ) virus subtype, is very rare and is of a low pathogenicity and its cases are reported only in China. Avian flu symptoms depends of type of virus subtype infection. Preliminary symptoms of A ( H5N1 ) virus include high fever, cough, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, runny nose, muscle ache. Also, lower respiratory tract problems emerge early in patients.

Avian Flu Treatment Market: Drivers and Restraints 
Infection of avian flu virus is suspected and diagnosed on the basis of clinical representation, history of contact with infected case or a positive laboratory test. Thus, awareness will lead to better diagnosis, which in turn will drive the avian flu market. Avian flu pandemic at any point of time can drive the market in the future since the influenza virus different rates in different places such as in 2014, H5N8, a highly infectious subtype of avian influenza, caused disease outbreaks in poultry, starting from South Korea, followed by Asia, Europe, and North America. Also, the various guidelines and recommendation from government authorities will lead to better diagnosis and treatment. However, resistance to existing antivirals can negatively impact the sales of antiviral drugs since it will lead to changes in treatment guidelines.

Avian Flu Treatment Market: Overview 
Global avian flu treatment marketis expected to witness healthy CAGR over the forecast period due to increase in awareness and diagnosis of avian flu. Increasing burden of avian flu on healthcare systems of endemic region such as Southeast Asia, China will lead to more stringent preventive measures in these regions. Treatment with the antiviral medications such as oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) or zanamivir ( Relenza ) should be started immediately to stop disease progression. Also, it is being reported that the antiviral medicines amantadine and rimantadine should not be used in the case of an H5N1 outbreak occurs due to antiviral resistance. Authorities such as WHO, the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ), and the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) are collaborating to assess and address the risk of avian flu 
Avian Flu Treatment Market: Regional Overview 
Region wise, the global avian flu treatment marketis classified into seven regions namely, North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific, Japan, Middle East and Africa. North America has conventionally dominated the global market for avian flu treatment market due to heightened awareness and good reimbursement policies. Asia-pacific and Africa remains highly susceptible due to past endemics. Although the outbreak of avian flu remains unpredictable but recent outbreaks in France, Nigeria, and Vietnam will push the market.

Kathmandu, May 8 
After a death due to bird flu was made public, demand for poultry products has come down. 

However, Sher Bahadur Pun, coordinator of clinical research unit at Teku-based Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, has reassured the public that bird flu virus deos n't spread if properly cooked chicken and eggs are consumed. 
He said since the bird flu victim died more than a month ago, the virus was unlikely to spread from person to person. 
Pun said, `` Poultry products can be consumed without any fear after cooking them at a temperature of up to 70 degrees Celsius. '' 
He, however, cautioned people working in poultry farms, those transporting poultry products, butchers and their helpers to take precautions, as they were always in close contact with poultry and poultry products. Pun claimed that poultry diagnosed with the virus had already been culled.

Ebola response in Butembo resumes after 5 days; 4 new cases noted. 
The Democratic Republic of the Congo's ( DRC's ) ministry of health confirmed that Ebola outbreak response activities partially resumed today in Butembo, after being suspended for 5 days due to several acts of violence. Four cases of Ebola were confirmed, and 5 new deaths were recorded, raising the outbreak's total to 1,604 cases, including 1,074 deaths. A total of 264 suspected cases are still under investigation. The low number of reported cases, after a month of increased activity, likely reflects a lag in reporting caused by the security incidents. Yesterday, DRC officials said two Katwa health workers -- including one who had been vaccinated -- had contracted Ebola, raising the number of health workers infected in this outbreak to 97. In an update today, the World Health Organization ( WHO ) said more violent attacks will likely expand the outbreak beyond North Kivu and Ituri provinces. In the past 21 days, 93 % of cases have originated in Katwa, Butembo, Mandima, Mabalako, Musienene, Beni, and Kalunguta health zones. `` The ongoing violent attacks sow fear, perpetuate mistrust, and further compound the multitude of challenges already faced by frontline healthcare workers, '' the WHO said. May 8 DRC update May 9 DRC update May 9 WHOupdate WHO profiles recent Saudi MERS cases as country notes new one. 
The WHO today provided more details on 36 MERS-CoV cases, 12 of them fatal, reported from Saudi Arabia between Mar 1 and Apr 8 that were n't part of a large outbreak in Wadi ad-Dawasir. Of the 36 cases, 10 were in Khafji and 6 in Riyadh. Nine patients had a history of exposure to camels or camel milk, and 12 had been exposed to another MERS-CoV ( Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ) patient. Five involved healthcare workers, all from Eastern region, presumably linked to the illnesses in Khafji. Patient ages ranged from 22 to 80, and all but 8 of them were male. Three apparently had asymptomatic infections, and 24 had underlying medical conditions. The WHO said the new cases do n't change its overall MERS-CoV risk assessment. The agency added that it expects cases to continue to be reported in the Middle East, along with possible exported cases involving people who contract the virus from camels, animal products such as camel milk, and humans, especially those in healthcare settings. Since 2012 when the virus was first detected in humans the WHO has been notified of 2,419 MERS-CoV cases, at least 836 of them fatal. The vast majority are from Saudi Arabia. May 9 WHO update. 
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health ( MOH ) reported a new illness in a 31-year-old man from Riyadh, according to a May 7 update to its epidemiologic week 19 report. It's not known if the man had contact with camels, and the source of his exposure is listed as primary, meaning he probably was n't exposed to sick patients. The case raises the 2019 Saudi total to 137 infections. May 8 Saudi MOH epi week 19 report CWD confirmed on deer farm in Crow Wing County, Minnesota. 
The Minnesota Board of Animal Health ( MBAH ) announced yesterday that at least seven animals at Trophy Woods Ranch, a captive deer farm in Crow Wing County, Minnesota, suffered from chronic wasting disease ( CWD ) in the last 2 years, and the animals likely spread the prion disease to deer in the wild. On Apr 16, animals at Trophy Woods Ranch were depopulated and tested for CWD after the ranch closed when a wild female deer near the property was found dead from CWD. A total of 102 deer were removed from the farm, and all viable samples were sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory for CWD testing. Seven animals tested positive for CWD, which raised the total number of CWD-infected animals associated with Trophy Woods to 14, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. Thirteen animals were too decomposed for testing. `` The results give us a clearer picture of the disease prevalence on the farm as we continue our efforts to contain and eliminate any remaining infectious CWD prions in the enclosed property, '' said Linda Glaser, DVM, the assistant director of MBAH, in an MBAH news release.CWD is a fatal prion disease in cervids, and has been documented across the United States, and in Canada, Scandinavia, and South Korea. The disease likely spreads when infected animals shed prions in saliva, feces, urine, and other fluids or tissues. No human cases have been recorded, but eating contaminated meat is not advised. May 8 MBAH news release May 8 Star Tribune article H9N2 avian flu infection reported in Oman. 
Oman has detected H9N2 avian flu in a 13-month-old baby girl from South Batinah governorate, according to a post yesterday from ProMED Mail, the online reporting system of the International Society for Infectious Diseases. The post cited a WHOvirus traceability notification that said H9N2 had been obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab, as well as a mention in a May 7 Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection weekly avian flu report that noted the baby's infection and said the illness onset was Mar 17. No information on the source of the virus or the patient's clinical details were available. A moderator's comment on the post noted a 2015 medical literature report of low-pathogenic H9N2 in mynah birds in Oman. May 8 ProMED Mail post Singapore sees first monkeypox case -- in Nigerian national. 
Singapore's ministry of health confirmed the countrys first case of monkeypox, in a Nigerian man who traveled to Singapore for a workshop last week. As of yesterday the man, 38, was hospitalized and in stable condition in an isolation ward at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. An additional 22 case contacts are under quarantine, health officials said. The Singapore Times reported the man had attended a wedding in Nigeria shortly before his trip, and may have consumed bush meat during the celebration. Monkeypox is often transmitted from animals to humans via contaminated meat or rodents who have come into contact with infected animals. Though human-to-human transmission is possible, it requires very close contact. Monkeypox is a self-limiting disease, with most symptoms resolving within 3 weeks.

May 10, 2019 - The H5N1 influenza virus, commonly known as bird flu, has been detected among the chickens reared by a farmer at Madhyabindu Municipality in Nawalparasi ( East ). Dr Shyam Krishna Tiwari, chief of the municipal veterinary service unit, said bird flu virus was detected among the chickens belonging to Pitambar Mahato. 
Mahato had taken the samples collected from his chickens to the National Avian Disease Investigation Laboratory in Chitwan for test after some 0f the fowls started dying in the coop. 
The lab results confirmed that the chickens had contracted the avian flu, Dr Tiwari said. After the lab confirmed the bird flu virus, a joint team of technicians from Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperative Management of Gandaki Province, Livestock Development Office, National Avian Disease Investigation Laboratory and the municipality was deployed to Mahato's farm to cull the chickens. The team also destroyed the poultry and feeds belonging to Mahato's neighbours. 
The local administration has urged the local poultry farmers to stop rearing fowls until the bird flu comes under complete control.

Thirty-five farms in Belgium have been affected by a strand of avian influenza that is harmless to humans, the country's agriculture department says. Since the beginning of April, a few dozen poultry farms have been affected by a bird flu virus. The farms are mainly located in West Flanders. The Federal Minister for Agriculture Denis Ducarme emphasises that the virus in question is ` completely harmless to human health '. Moreover, the virus in question - bird flu virus of the H3 type - is not on the list of regulated and notifiable diseases. The virus can cause symptoms in poultry, ranging from a fall in production to death. Currently 35 poultry farms have been affected. The H3 strain was confirmed for 27 of them. Together with the sector, the government is working on measures to curb the further spread of the disease. Animals infected or showing symptoms of the virus will be slaughtered.

May 11, 2019 - The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division says it is preparing to send specimens collected from the people who came in close contact with the person who died after contracting the H5N1 ( bird flu ) virus on March 29. 
The division, under the Department of Health Services, had formed a team of medical doctors and lab technicians to carry out an epidemiological investigation after the death of a 21-year-old from Kavrepalanchok district from the bird flu virus. 
`` We have collected specimens from doctors, nurses, close family members, relatives, and hospitals -- and also from homes, '' Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director at the division, told the Post. 
The name of the deceased has not been disclosed yet, but he was said to be residing in Bhaktapur in a rented room and worked as a driver. 
The Health Ministry, however, announced only on April 30 that the man had died from H5N1. Throat swabs of the deceased had been sent to the World Health Organisation's Collaborating Centre for Influenza in Japan, which confirmed that he had contracted Influenza A ( H5N1 ), which caused his death. 
Following the confirmation of deadly virus responsible for the death, health experts from the WHO's headquarters and its regional office in New Delhi, India arrived in Kathmandu to assist Nepali health officials to carry out an epidemiological investigation. 
According to Lal, his office would send samples to the country recommended by the UN health agency. 
Earlier, WHO officials suggested that specimens be sent to the Collaborating Center for Influenza in Japan that confirmed the virus. Such labs are in several countries and the UN health body may recommend any one of them. 
`` We are working closely with them and will decide our next step accordingly, '' said Lal. 
The division has secured all collected samples in the biosafety level-3 laboratory of the National Public Health Laboratory. 
Health officials say it takes time to send samples to laboratories abroad, as manpower trained to handle the biohazard are required for that. 
Airlines do not easily carry such specimens and for that, protocols of international health regulations need to be followed, according to officials at the Health Ministry. 
Meanwhile, the ministry said it was still tracking some people, who came in contact with the deceased but are out of home for personal business. 
The death of the 21-year-old from H5N1 virus, the first bird flu casualty in Nepal and first in the world since February 2017, has been a cause for concern. H5N1 is a lethal bird flu virus strain that is highly pathogenic.

A clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA ( mRNA ) therapeutics and vaccines announced the publication of results from two Phase 1 clinical studies. 
These small, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies showed that mRNA vaccine candidates VAL-339851 and VAL-506440 targeted against H10N8 and H7N9 influenza viruses were well-tolerated and elicited robust immune responses. 
H10N8 and H7N9 influenza infections have previously demonstrated high fatality rates, however, neither have an approved vaccine. 
Both studies met their primary safety and secondary immunogenicity endpoints, and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported. 
These positive results support the potential of the mRNA-based vaccine to quickly and effectively address pandemic influenza strains, said Moderna, Inc., in a press release. 
Mike Watson, senior vice president at Moderna and a study co-author said, `` These Phase 1 data highlight the potential of Moderna's mRNA platform to demonstrate similar or better immunogenicity than existing vaccines, which can be rapidly produced in a multi-use facility. '' 
In the H10N8 study: 
201 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 64 years received two doses of VAL-506440 vaccine or placebo three weeks apart, intramuscularly ( IM ) at dose levels from 25 μg to 400 μg, or intradermally ( ID ) at dose levels of 25 μg or 50 μg. The 100 μg IM dose induced seroprotective immunity of hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) ≥ 1:40 in 100 percent of participants and microneutralization ( MN ) titers ≥ 1:20 in 87 percent of participants. The 25 μg ID dose induced HAI titers ≥ 1:40 in 64.7 percent of participants compared to 34.5 percent of participants receiving the IM dose. HAI titers of 1:40 and MN titers of 1:20 are expected to be protective in seasonal flu vaccines. 
H10N8 avian influenza first breached the avian-human species barrier in 2013 and was fatal in 2 of the 3 three persons infected. No additional H10N8 human infections have been reported, but the virus has a high affinity for the human receptor, and mutated strains with increased virulence are a significant concern. 
In the H7N9 study: 
156 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 49 years received two doses of VAL-339851 vaccine or placebo three weeks apart ( IM ) at dose levels of 10 μg, 25 μg, and 50 μg. A small subgroup also received two doses of 25 μg or 50 μg IM six months apart. IM doses of 10 μg, 25 μg, and 50 μg achieved HAI titers ≥ 1:40 in 36 percent, 96.3 percent and 89.7 percent of participants, respectively. MN titers ≥ 1:20 were achieved by 100 percent in the 10 μg and 25 μg groups and by 96.6 percent in the 50 μg group. 
Also in 2013, the first human H7N9 infections were reported in China, with a fatality rate of 37 %. Since 2013, five waves of H7N9 outbreaks have caused over 1500 documented infections and more than 600 deaths. 
Future development of Moderna's pandemic influenza program is contingent on government or other grant funding. 
This is the 3rd peer-reviewed publication of human data using Moderna mRNA technology. 
In the past three years, Moderna and collaborators have published more than 25 peer-reviewed papers, with 12 distributed in 2018. 
The mRNA vaccines and therapeutics market segment was recently forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 50 percent. 
Moderna is advancing messenger RNA ( mRNA ) science to create a new class of transformative medicines for patients. 
mRNA medicines are designed to direct the body's cells to produce intracellular, membrane or secreted proteins, that can have a therapeutic or preventive benefit and have the potential to address a broad spectrum of diseases.";"EN";2019-05-11 17:18:39;"1 6";

Dubai: The environmental ministry in the UAE on Sunday lifted the ban on all imports of live domestic and wild birds from Kuwait following a bird flu scare last February. 

According to a notice issued by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment ( MoCCAE ), is once again safe to import domestic and wild live birds, ornamental birds, chicks, hatching and table eggs, poultry meat, and their thermally non-treated products from Kuwait. 

The decision to implement the ban was carried out following a notification from the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases of the outbreak of a highly contagious strain of bird flu ( H5N8 ) in Kuwait. 

The MoCCAE said the ban would be in place until the outbreak was brought under control. 

The ministry said it works relentlessly to ensure that all foodstuffs and food products in the country, both domestically produced and imported, are safe and do not pose a threat to the public's health and safety.";"EN";2019-05-12 08:41:45;"1 6";

A British company has developed a simple test using a dipstick that it says could be used to identify equine influenza. 
Iceni Diagnostics has a patent for its approach to detecting and distinguishing between human and avian flu, and Chief Scientist Professor David Russell says a slight modification could provide a rapid non-invasive test for horses. 
Russell co-founded Iceni Diagnostics with fellow scientist Professor Robert Field, a project leader at bio-science institute the John Innes Centre and an international expert in carbohydrate chemistry. 
Field said that 90 % of infections use carbohydrate recognition to bind with targets in human or animal bodies. As the mechanism is specific to each particular strain of flu, it can be used to form a sensor for the disease. 
`` Our sensor uses sugars tagged with inexpensive gold nanoparticles; if the virus is present it will stick to the particles, pulling them closer together. This creates a photophysics reaction and the sample changes colour. 
Professor Rob Field 
`` We have found that there are differences between the carbohydrate detectors in the different types of flu. It is therefore possible to use a colour change to identify presence and absence of the virus and to distinguish between them. '' 

By using sugars instead of more commonly used protein-based diagnostics, which need cold storage, the simple low technology approach has potential for use worldwide with minimal training, providing results in seconds. It could be used as a routine screen to give an ` all clear ' to horses before they travel to race meets and other gatherings. 
Russell said that the new assay based on gold nanoparticles is faster than current methods of detection; Results showed that functionalised gold nanoparticles were able to detect the human influenza virus X31 ( H3N2 ) within 30 minutes. 

`` Preventing a new influenza pandemic requires both vaccination and antiviral drugs to be administered within 48 hours of the infection in order to contain the disease. 
`` Current methods of detection require isolation and culturing of the virus, which may take several hours or even days to get the results. Using our test it would be possible to quickly identify infected animals at the stables and quarantine them, preventing the spread of disease. '' 
Carbohydrate chemistry is complex, and Iceni Diagnostics is seeking investment to modify its sensor to provide an equine flu dip test.

Outbreaks of virulent Newcastle disease ( vND ) that have spread from backyard to commercial flocks in California are providing a wake-up call to the entire US poultry industry about the need for ND monitoring and adherence to strict biosecurity, Joseph Giambrone, PhD, a professor at Auburn University, told Poultry Health Today. 
As of this writing, USDA has confirmed more than 400 cases of vND in California that include three commercial layer flocks. There has also been a case in Utah as well as one in Arizona; both involve small backyard flocks and are believed to be connected to the California outbreak. 
`` No question about it, '' Giambrone said when asked if the US poultry industry should be concerned about these regional outbreaks. 
Virulent ND is a highly contagious, deadly viral disease also called `` exotic ND '' or velogenic ND. The professor explained that it affects both the respiratory and enteric tracts. The source is virtually always backyard birds. It's a difficult situation because it's impossible to keep track of backyard birds and their numbers, he said, and noted that wild birds can also be a source of infection. 
On commercial farms, poultry houses become an incubator for vND due to their large size, and the problem is amplified, he said. 
Monitoring is essential 
Giambrone stressed the importance of monitoring. `` It's similar to avian influenza in that you have to continually, continually monitor. '' If anything out of the ordinary is found, such as increased mortality or a combination of respiratory and enteric disease, it needs to be reported to the state veterinarian. The farm may need to be quarantined. 
Commercial farms need to remain vigilant about biosecurity and make sure anyone who comes onto the farm has no contact with backyard birds. Care must be taken to avoid exposing flocks to vND due to sharing of contaminated equipment, which is one of the ways avian influenza is spread, he said. 
At least in the southeastern US, where most of the poultry industry is concentrated, live-bird markets are n't permitted as they are in California, Giambrone added, which helps reduce the spread of vND. 
The role of vaccination, he continued, takes on added importance in light of the California vND outbreaks, but it can be difficult, particularly for layer producers with birds in cages and automated water systems. It's hard to get all the birds to drink the water, and live ND vaccines can be reactive and affect egg production and shell quality. 
`` So, commercial producers are reluctant to continue to vaccinate, '' he explained. In addition, it costs money to vaccinate, and both live and killed ND vaccines are only effective for a certain amount of time, Giambrone said. 
Nevertheless, he thinks vaccination is good insurance. The question is how much protection each farm needs. `` How much insurance are you willing to pay for? '' Giambrone asked. 
`` With Newcastle, at least we have the vaccines to prevent the spread. '' For commercial layer farms anywhere near farms with an outbreak, `` it would be incumbent on you to do serological testing ... then re-vaccinate, even if it's going to cost you in production, '' Giambrone said.";"EN";2019-05-14 06:08:16;"1 6";

Avian influenza ( AI ), generally called bird flu, is an infectious viral disease of birds. I t is generally found in some species of water birds mainly in wild water fowl such as ducks and geese. Avian influenza virus sometimes infect poultry and other birds resulting in outbreaks. Avian influenza is usually rare in humans but sometimes it passes to human and other species due to close contact with the infected bird. The common virus which can infect humans are A ( H5N1 ) and A ( H7N9 ). Avian flu viruses are characterized into two high pathogenicity or low pathogenicity. The risk of transmission of avian flu is in those people who work in poultry, travel to virus infected countries, contact with infected bird and by eating raw or under cooked meat or eggs. 
The A ( H5N1 ) virus subtype, is highly pathogenic, the first infection in humans of this virus was reported in 1997 in Hong Kong. After that the virus has spread to Asia, Europe and Africa and have affected many countries on large-scale, causing millions of poultry infections, several hundred human cases, and many human deaths. These avian flu outbreaks in poultry have seriously impacted livelihoods, the economy and international trade in affected countries. The A ( H7N9 ) virus subtype, is very rare and is of a low pathogenicity and its cases are reported only in China. Avian flu symptoms depends of type of virus subtype infection. Preliminary symptoms of A ( H5N1 ) virus include high fever, cough, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, runny nose, muscle ache. Also, lower respiratory tract problems emerge early in patients.

The A ( H5N1 ) virus subtype, is highly pathogenic, the first infection in humans of this virus was reported in 1997 in Hong Kong. After that the virus has spread to Asia, Europe and Africa and have affected many countries on large-scale, causing millions of poultry infections, several hundred human cases, and many human deaths.

Global avian flu treatment market is expected to witness healthy CAGR over the forecast period due to increase in awareness and diagnosis of avian flu. Increasing burden of avian flu on healthcare systems of endemic region such as Southeast Asia, China will lead to more stringent preventive measures in these regions. Treatment with the antiviral medications such as oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) or zanamivir ( Relenza ) should be started immediately to stop disease progression. 
Also, it is being reported that the antiviral medicines amantadine and rimantadine should not be used in the case of an H5N1 outbreak occurs due to antiviral resistance. Authorities such as WHO, the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ), and the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) are collaborating to assess and address the risk of avian flu 
These avian flu outbreaks in poultry have seriously impacted livelihoods, the economy and international trade in affected countries. The A ( H7N9 ) virus subtype, is very rare and is of a low pathogenicity and its cases are reported only in China. Avian flu symptoms depends of type of virus subtype infection. Preliminary symptoms of A ( H5N1 ) virus include high fever, cough, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, runny nose, muscle ache. Also, lower respiratory tract problems emerge early in patients. 
Avian Flu Treatment Market: Drivers and Restraints: Infection of avian flu virus is suspected and diagnosed on the basis of clinical representation, history of contact with infected case or a positive laboratory test. Thus, awareness will lead to better diagnosis, which in turn will drive the avian flu market. Avian flu pandemic at any point of time can drive the market in the future since the influenza virus different rates in different places such as in 2014, H5N8, a highly infectious subtype of avian influenza, caused disease outbreaks in poultry, starting from South Korea, followed by Asia, Europe, and North America. Also, the various guidelines and recommendation from government authorities will lead to better diagnosis and treatment. However, resistance to existing antivirals can negatively impact the sales of antiviral drugs since it will lead to changes in treatment guidelines. Avian Flu Treatment Market: Regional Overview: Region wise, the global avian flu treatment marketis classified into seven regions namely, North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific, Japan, Middle East and Africa. North America has conventionally dominated the global market for avian flu treatment market due to heightened awareness and good reimbursement policies. Asia-pacific and Africa remains highly susceptible due to past endemics. Although the outbreak of avian flu remains unpredictable but recent outbreaks in France, Nigeria, and Vietnam will push the market.

May 19, 2019 - The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has collected specimens of 179 people who came in contact with a man who died from bird flu virus ( H5N1 ). 
Of the 179 samples, 172 were taken from hospital staff -- doctors, nurses, lab technicians, cleaning staff and others, who were involved in the treatment of the patient. The remaining seven samples are of the family members of the deceased, according to the division. 
`` We are preparing to send samples abroad for tests, '' Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director at the division told the Post, `` I can assure you that no other people have so far been infected with the deadly disease. '' He said that the division would send samples to the laboratory, recommended by the World Health Organization. 
The division had formed a rapid response team following the confirmation of H5N1 virus to be the cause of death of a 21-year-old man from Kavrepalanchok district, who had been residing in a rented room in Bhaktapur. 
The unidentified man died on March 29, while receiving treatment for influenza-like illness in Kathmandu. Doctors at the hospital, where he was admitted for treatment, had sent his throat swab for examination at the National Public Health Laboratory. The laboratory failed to confirm the type of virus and sent the specimens to the WHO's Collaborating Center for Influenza in Japan, which confirmed the presence of Influenza A ( H5N1 ) on April 30. 
Following the confirmation of the deadly virus responsible for the death of a patient, a jumbo rapid response team of 35 members, comprising experts from the WHO regional Office in Delhi, WHO Nepal country office, WHO-South-East Asia Region, Food and Agriculture of the United Nations, UNICEF, World Food Programme was formed to carry out an epidemiological surveillance. 
Doctors from Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Teku, lab technicians from the National Public Health Laboratory, doctors from Patan Hospital, members of the National Health Information Education and Communication Center and experts from the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development had also participated in the surveillance. 
Dr Samir Kumar Adhikari, chief of zoonotic and other communicable disease management section, said that the samples would be sent to the country recommended by UN health agency. 
`` We have initiated the process to send the collected samples out of the country for examination, '' said Adhikari. He however, refused to reveal name of the country where the samples are being sent. 
Earlier, WHO officials suggested sending specimens to its Collaborating Center for Influenza in Japan, which confirmed the virus. Such labs are in several countries and the UN health body suggests sending samples to these countries, according to Adhikari. 
The division has contained all collected samples in biosafety level-3 laboratory of the National Public Health Laboratory. 
The government has not yet revealed the identity of the man who had died of bird flu virus. It was the first case of death in Nepal from the contagious virus and first H5N1 human infection since February 2017. Doctors say H5N1 or bird flu virus is a lethal bird flu virus strain that is highly pathogenic

Geothermica, 15, and Sambisig, 17, will be brought to Singapore's Jurong Bird Park to increase their population. ABS-CBN News 

DAVAO CITY - Two Philippine eagles will be brought to Singapore next month as part of a breeding loan agreement to increase the eagles ' population. 
The pair, a 15-year-old male named Geothermica and a 17-year-old female named Sambisig, will be housed at Jurong Bird Park, which is managed by the Wildlife Reserves Singapore ( WRS ). 
`` Primary objective is to secure population of the species elsewhere. This is primarily to protect the Philippine eagle from threats of outbreak of diseases or calamities, '' said Dennis Salvador, executive director of the Philippine Eagle Foundation. 
According to Salvador, the DENR's plan to loan Philippine eagles to other countries for breeding and conservation began 10 years ago but it was only approved this year. 
This measure aims to protect Philippine eagles from bird flu and the effects of natural calamities. 
`` We did n't have avian flu in the past but in the recent years nagka outbreak sa Pampanga and because of this nature, like this avian influenza, can potentially wipe out the entire captive flock in one go. we want to be sure na may gene pool tayo elsewhere, '' Salvador added. 
PEF believes the pair can produce offspring. 
`` They have the great potential of really bonding. And now in their prime breeding age. We basically want this thing to succeed as much as possible so were giving Singapore every opportunity they can to have a successful breeding program '', said Salvador. 
There are 32 eagles under the care of PEC. 
This is the first time the Philippines is lending Philippine eagles to another country. It comes as the Philippines and Singapore mark 50 years of diplomatic relations.";"EN";2019-05-21 13:19:00;"1 6";

Method developed to store antiviral vaccines at high temperatures. 
It a development that has the potential to replace cold chain antiviral vaccine storage systems that make it difficult to immunize people in remote and low-resource regions of the world, researchers today described a stable, affordable system for storing fragile vaccines for weeks. Researchers based at Mc. 
Master University described their findings today in Scientific Reports. The new system combines active vaccine ingredients with a sugary gel containing pullulan and trehalose that had already been developed by Mc. 
Master chemical engineers as an edible coating to prolong the shelf life of fruits and vegetables. The technique adds a marginal cost to preparing the vaccine, but eliminates nearly all the transport cost, which can make up 80 % of the total cost of the vaccine. The vaccine can be stored at temperatures as high as 104 ° F ( 40 ° C ) for 8 weeks or more. The method stores the active component in a tiny one-dose container filled with the sugar-gel combination that seals the vaccine. When administering the vaccine, the clinician reconstitutes it with water as he or she normally would. Ali Ashkar, DVM, PhD, study coauthor and professor of pathology and molecular medicine at Mc. 
Master said in a press release from the university, `` You can spend all kinds of money developing a vaccine, but if it is deactivated by high temperature an hour before you can give it to someone, it does n't matter. `` The team successfully used the system on two sample vaccines using influenza and herpes simplex to inoculate mice. They note that the ingredients in the storage medium are already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The researchers are working with a commercial partner to bring the technology to market. May 21 Sci Rep abstract May 21 Mc. 
Master University press release WHO: Spike of dengue activity in French territory, Reunion Island. 
The French territory of Reunion, an island east of Madagascar, has noted a sharp increase in dengue cases since early 2018, according to an update from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) yesterday. `` A total of 6,942 confirmed locally acquired cases of dengue fever were reported in Reunion in 2018, a 6,000 % increase from 2017, when 100 cases were reported, '' the WHO said. Since Jan 1 of this year, officials have recorded more than 7,700 confirmed dengue cases. So far 14 deaths since 2018 have been linked to dengue infections, and emergency room visits rose from 475 in 2018 to 1,102 in 2019. Reunion's first dengue outbreak took place in 1977 and 1978, and officials estimate about 30 % of the population has been infected with the virus. The surge in new cases could be explained by either an increase in the viral load of asymptomatic cases over the threshold values of infectivity for mosquito vectors, or a lack of herd immunity in the local population for the prevailing serotypes. The WHO also said the co-circulation of different serotypes may also be contributing to transmission. May 20 WHO update Vietnam and Mexico report high-path avian flu outbreaks. 
In the latest highly pathogenic avian flu developments involving poultry, Vietnam reported an H5N1 outbreak in village birds and Mexico reported five more H7N3 outbreaks, mainly in backyard birds. Vietnam's outbreak began on May 4 in a village in Hau Giang province in the far south of the country, according to a notification from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). The report did n't say how many birds died from the virus, but it noted that authorities culled 1,120 of them. The country reported its last H5N1 detection in March. Mexico's five H7N3 outbreaks are part of sporadic detections involving the strain since early April. Four of the events were in backyard poultry in Queretaro, Guerrero, and Tlaxcala states, all in the south central part of the country. The fifth involved a commercial layer farm in Queretaro state. The events began from Apr 24 to May 7 and are considered resolved. The virus killed 1,266 of 2,107 susceptible birds, and authorities destroyed the remaining ones as part of response steps.

Clinical guideline developed for flu testing in emergency departmentsUS scientists have developed and validated a clinical decision guideline ( CDG ) for flu testing in emergency departments, according to a study yesterday in Clinical Infectious Diseases. To develop the CDG, researchers conducted a cohort study involving 1,941 patients with fever or respiratory symptoms seen at four US emergency departments in 2013 and 2014. Of those patients, 118 ( 9.4 % ) tested positive for influenza virus. Based on clinical signs and intake, the researchers derived a CDG that included four criteria: new or increased cough ( 2 points ), headache ( 1 point ), subjective fever ( 1 point ), and triage temperature greater than 100.4 ° C ( 1 point ). A score of 3 or more points indicated influenza testing was warranted. When applied to study participants, 66.1 % of the symptomatic population met the CDG criteria for influenza testing. The CDG is not meant to be used in pediatric populations, the authors said, and should be used in conjunction with highly sensitive influenza testing. `` The use of this CDG in practice could have important impacts on individual patient's treatment, as well as the population as a whole, through focused infection control measures, '' the authors said. May 21 Clin Infect Dis study Genetic analysis of Midwest poultry H5N2 outbreaks yields new cluesA new analysis of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian flu outbreaks that struck the Midwestern poultry industry in 2015 found that road density was a driver of viral spread, hinting a human role in carrying the virus between farms, and multiple introductions from wild birds does n't appear likely. Researchers from the University of Georgia, the University of Connecticut, and the US Department of Agriculture published their findings yesterday in the preprint server bio. 
Rxiv. To learn more about what fueled the outbreak, the group analyzed 182 full-genome H5N2 sequences collected from commercial layer and turkey farms hit by the outbreaks and then factored the information into models that included epidemiologic and geographic information. The investigators found that layer chickens and turkeys seemed to represent two separate host populations that interacted with each other, but did not receive the virus from an ongoing external source. Their models suggested that layer chicken farms were infectious much longer than turkey farms, possibly explaining why the transmission rate from chicken farms to turkey farms was higher than from turkey farms to chicken farms. Though turkeys survived longer than chickens, turkey premises were depopulated more quickly than layer facilities. The researchers note that their genetic findings support earlier findings that virus spread among Minnesota's poultry farms were distance-dependent. High road-density findings correlate with better logistic connectivity between farms, boosting the chances that an infected farm will export the virus to nearby farms and counties, a factor seen in earlier poultry outbreaks overseas. One factor they looked at that had a relatively small effect size was the proportion of a county covered by surface water, which in countries like China has been associated with greater avian influenza dispersal due to waterfowl migration. Implications for future surveillance and control may be that though wild birds can initially introduce the virus, outbreaks can be maintained without additional ones, the team wrote. Biosecurity measures may have been enough to prevent continued introductions from outside sources, but may not have been as effective against local farm-to-farm transmission. The authors point out that biosecurity factors might explain why the Midwest's broiler chicken industry was spared from the outbreak.A better understanding of how affected farms are connected would help with control efforts, they say. `` With the knowledge of how these farms share personnel and equipment, future outbreaks could be contained by disruption of the transportation network, '' they wrote.

Avian influenza ( AI ), generally called bird flu, is an infectious viral disease of birds. I t is generally found in some species of water birds mainly in wild water fowl such as ducks and geese. Avian influenza virus sometimes infect poultry and other birds resulting in outbreaks. Avian influenza is usually rare in humans but sometimes it passes to human and other species due to close contact with the infected bird. The common virus which can infect humans are A ( H5N1 ) and A ( H7N9 ). Avian flu viruses are characterized into two high pathogenicity or low pathogenicity. The risk of transmission of avian flu is in those people who work in poultry, travel to virus infected countries, contact with infected bird and by eating raw or under cooked meat or eggs.

24 May 2019The study also found that the Spanish Influenza's early manifestation was ignored at the time as a `` minor infection ''. It is believed that, if doctors had recognized that influenza was the cause of an illness which was killing soldiers in Etaples, France, and Aldershot, England, in 1916, scientists could have then created a vaccination programme and some of the worst effects of the Spanish Influenza could have been avoided. 
Published in the journal Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics, the study uses modern day scientific technology and literature published in The Lancet from the time, to not only track the origins of the virus, but to seek how we can learn from the past to prevent the spread of an influenza pandemic. 
Long-neglected outbreaks 
Professor John Oxford, a virologist from Queen Mary's Blizard Institute said: `` We have identified long-neglected outbreaks of infection: outbreaks which, judged as minor at the time, can now be seen as increasingly important, and a portent of the disaster to come. 
`` The research undertaken in the production of the Etaples paper was particularly exhaustive in its scope and depth. Not only were the usual examinations undertaken, of tissue and sputum, but a postmortem examination was conducted of every single soldier dying of disease, throughout a period of seven weeks in early 1917. '' 
Professor Oxford and Douglas Gill, a military historian, traced the origins of the Spanish Influenza as it emerged in 1915 and 1916 in the Etaples Administrative District in northern France. At the time, up to 30,000 soldiers were admitted each year to British army hospitals in France and England, suffering from typical influenza symptoms. In early 1917, however, a medical group in Etaples treated hundreds of patients infected with what they described as an `` unusually fatal disease '' presenting `` complex '' respiratory symptoms. 
In Aldershot, in the south of England, three senior physicians were also tackling a problem whose hallmarks looked very much the same. In both instances, the disease was characterised by a rapid progression from quite minor symptoms to death. Both medical groups were encountering a case fatality in the order of 50 per cent, and they were learning from colleagues in England and France that the malady was occurring elsewhere. 
It is this information which has helped Professor Oxford and Gill to track what was then believed to be a minor respiratory infection as the very origins of the biggest killing pandemic of the 20th century. 
Mutated virus gained a marked ability to spread 
The findings are further supported in modern papers analysed by Professor Oxford and Gill which point to all eight genes of the H1N1 family of influenza A viruses as emerging in 1915 - 1916. These modern studies have also shown that the ` emerging virus ' began with aquatic geese, ducks, and swans as a reservoir. It is likely that this disease was then passed on to the soldiers through the faeces of migrating water birds. 
Professor Oxford explains: `` In essence, the virus must have mutated. It lost a great deal of its virulence, but gained a marked ability to spread. Recent experiments with a pre-pandemic ` bird flu ' called H5N1, deliberately mutated in the laboratory, have shown that as few as five mutations could have permitted this change to take place. 
`` We appreciate today that a unique characteristic of a pre-pandemic virus lies in its inability to spread from person to person. The teams at Etaples and Aldershot, although strong in clinical diagnosis, were misled by the lack of spread of this infection. Accordingly, they failed to pinpoint influenza as the underlying cause. 
`` Once the virus is able to spread from human to human, disaster strikes. With a generation time of two to three days, from just three patients who were infected originally, a million infections can be caused in around 40 days. And this is probably exactly what happened in 1918 - 1919. '' 
A silver lining to a very dark cloud 
Today, the World Health Organization is on full alert; and every nation in the world has been asked to plan for a pandemic of bird influenza A ( H5N1 ) or ( H7N9 ). 
By understanding the origins of The Spanish Influenza through analysing modern day research and papers written in 1917, it is hoped this study could help prevent a new influenza pandemic. 
Professor Oxford added: `` Something similar to what happened at the beginning of the twentieth century could easily be repeated. As a precaution, governments everywhere are stockpiling vaccines against the pneumococcus that usually develops as a secondary infection after the flu, and which causes fatalities on a very large scale.

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) expressed appreciation to the Directorate General of Livestock and Animal Health Services of the Ministry of Agriculture ( DGLAHS MoA ) for its success in controlling Avian Influenza ( AI ), popularly known as ` bird flu ' or ` flu burung '. `` FAO has supported the Government's avian influenza control program since 2006. Throughout the 13 years of collaboration, we acknowledge the continuous decline in the number of avian flu cases, '' said FAO Representative to Indonesia and Timor Leste Stephen Rudgard during a meeting with the Director General of Livestock and Animal Health Services, Dr I Ketut Diarmita in Jakarta, on May 28. The Ministry of Agriculture noted that the annual number of poultry avian influenza outbreaks dropped from 2,751 in 2007 to 476 in 2018. Avian Influenza is caused by a virus that attacks all domestic poultry including chickens, ducks and quail. The disease that can be transmitted to humans with some strains causing a high mortality rate. Indonesia has suffered from the bird flu virus since August 2003 with virus spread to many regions of the country over the years. In order to protect human health and poultry production in the country, the Government supported intensive bird flu control campaigns. Ketut expressed his appreciation to FAO for its contribution to the control of Avian Influenza in Indonesia. Many successes have been achieved under the cooperation framework between the Government and FAO. Currently, bird flu control is focused on improving farm biosecurity, disease prevention through flock vaccination and certification of compartments as free from Avian Influenza. Another element of the program supports monitoring the dynamics of bird flu viruses circulating in the field to produce effective local poultry vaccines to protect farmers ' flocks. 

This strategy has succeeded in reducing Avian Flu cases on farms and certifying commercial farms as AI-free compartments. AI-free certification makes Indonesian poultry products exportable to several Asian countries said Ketut. `` Countries like Japan, which have very high animal health requirements, will accept Indonesian poultry products in recognition of Indonesian animal health and food safety guarantees, '' he added. Team Leader of the FAO Emergency Center for Transboundary Animal Diseases ( FAO ECTAD Indonesia ) James Mc. 
Grane said that the close collaboration between the Government of Indonesia and FAO should be continued under a new Emerging Disease Threats program to guarantee long-term sustainable impact. `` The continuation of this international cooperation will strengthen Indonesia's capacity to protect people and their livelihoods from transboundary animal disease threats, '' Mc. 
Grane said. Ketut welcomed the offer of continued collaboration with FAO and hoped that joint activities would bring maximum benefits for the development of livestock production and animal health in Indonesia.FAO | TEMPO";"EN";2019-05-29 07:02:48;"1 6";

The Mexican government will allow 55,000 additional tons of tariff-free chicken imports from the U.S. as the country works through an avian flu outbreak. The move raises the tariff-free quota to 355,000 tons of the imported poultry, according to Mexico's official gazette, and covers fresh, refrigerated, or frozen meat. The move is not without its restrictions; several U.S. counties are banned from exporting to Mexico based on an outbreak of Virulent Newcastle disease, which USDA has confirmed on 433 premises primarily in southern California. According to the Mexican government, avian flu has been confirmed in about two-thirds of the country's 31 states. USDA describes chicken as `` the most affordable and preferred animal protein in Mexico '' and expect 4.4 million metric tons of it to be consumed in 2019. Imports are expected to make up about 840,000 MT of that, with the U.S. expected to hold onto its dominant market share. The U.S. held an 86 percent market share in Mexico in 2017, but Brazil looks to be a more formidable competitor in 2019.

Sunrise Farms filed a lawsuit against companies hired by the federal government to depopulate and disinfect its property after highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected at its facility near Harris, Iowa, in 2015. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) contracted Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Sabre Energy Services and KDF Enterprises, while Clean Harbors hired six subcontractors to do the needed jobs to enable the company to eventually repopulate the egg company's facility.

'' Sunrise also claimed the defendants were negligent and breached their contracts, according to a NWest. 
Iowa.com report. 
Sunrise Farms seeks to be fully compensated for its losses, interest, accrued late charges and the cost of its lawsuit. 
The lawsuit was first filed in Osceola County District Court, Sibley, Iowa. However, the case was moved to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa in March. A jury trial has been set for January 2020 in Sioux City. 
In separate legal action, Clean Harbors Environmental Services sued each of the six companies with which it subcontracted. 
While Minnesota had the most confirmed cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza during the 2014 - 15 outbreak, it was Iowa that had the most birds affected. Nearly 32 million birds in Iowa were lost between April 19 and June 17, 2015. 
Sunrise Farms, according to the WATTAg. 
Net Top Poultry Companies Database, is the 23rd largest egg company in the United States. At the conclusion of 2018, the Sunrise Farms had a flock of 4.1 million hens.

CDC: 10 more people infected with Salmonella linked to hedgehogs. 
The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) yesterday announced 10 more cases of Salmonella Typhimurium illness linked to pet hedgehogs, and 6 more states are affected. The new cases raise the outbreak total to 27 cases in 17 states. Two people have been hospitalized in this outbreak, but there have been no reported deaths. Forty-two percent of cases involve children aged 12 or younger, the CDC said. In interviews, 90 % of patients said they had contact with a hedgehog prior to symptom onset. Illnesses were reported from Oct 22, 2018, to Apr 8, 2019. `` The outbreak strain of Salmonella Typhimurium was identified in samples collected from 10 hedgehogs in Minnesota, including 5 hedgehogs from the homes of five ill patients. A common source of hedgehogs has not been identified, '' the CDC said. Minnesota has the most recorded cases, with 5, followed by Missouri ( 3 ), and California, Indiana, Virginia, and Wyoming with 2 each. Eleven states have reported 1 case. The CDC recommends good hygiene when handling pet hedgehogs and says to avoid kissing or snuggling the animals. May 30 CDC update CDC records 2 new pediatric flu deaths, 1 variant H1N1 case.

European health officials recently reported a novel H1N2 infection in Denmark, a reassortment involving two seasonal flu strains: the 2009 H1N1 virus and H3N2. The original source of the report was the European Union Early Warning and Response System ( EWRS ), according to a post yesterday on Avian Flu Diary ( AFD ), an infectious disease news blog. The latest novel H1N2 case marks Europe's third in just over a year; earlier cases were detected in March 2018 in the Netherlands and in February 2019 in Sweden. In the Danish case, the sample was collected on Apr 11 as part of routine surveillance. The patient is a 74-year-old unvaccinated woman who had traveled by plane to Croatia, then returned home after also visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina. Her symptoms began after returning to Denmark on Apr 7, and she was hospitalized on Apr 11. She was discharged on Apr 13. It's not clear where she contracted the virus. No other cases have been detected in other contacts or fellow travelers.A genetic analysis of the novel H1N2 virus found that has a hemagglutinin gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus and a neuraminidase gene from H3N2. No evidence of coinfection was found. Last year, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said in a risk assessment that the reassortant H1N2 virus is similar to other seasonal flu viruses and that current seasonal flu vaccines are likely to offer some protection. It also said the virus does n't show any markers to suggest resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors.

US measles cases rise by 41, to 981, highest since 1992In its regular weekly report on measles, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) today reported 41 more illnesses since its update the previous week, boosting the year's total so far to 981 cases. The CDC added that this year's number so far is the highest in the United States since 1992 and the highest since the disease was eliminated in 2000. The number of states reporting cases remained at 26, and the number of outbreaks that are ongoing held steady at 10. Much of the rise in new cases appears to be from some of the larger outbreaks that are still under way. For example, an outbreak in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens as of May 29 has totaled 550 cases, an increase of 15 from the previous week. An outbreak in New York's Rockland County as of yesterday has 255 confirmed cases. And in California, which has had four outbreaks this year with links to international travel, health officials as of May 29 have reported 47 cases.

The study also found dramatic reductions in prevalence of vaccine-type ( VT ) HPV among women ages 20 to 29. To conduct the study, published in Vaccine, researchers used information gathered from screenings at Kaiser Permanente Northwest to compare prevalence of VT HPV in two vaccine time periods, 2012 through 2013 and 2015 through 2016 -- or approximately 6 to 7 and 9 to 10 years after national vaccine introduction in 2006 - -- with the prevalence in 2007. Overall, 12,788 specimens were included in the study. Among 20 - to 24-year - olds, VT prevalence decreased from 13.1 % in 2007 to 2.9 % in 2015 - 2016 ( prevalence ratio [ PR ], 0.22; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 0.17-0 .29 ). VT prevalence in 2015 - 2016 among 20 - to 24-year - olds was lower in both vaccinated ( 1.3 %; PR, 0.10; 95 % CI, 0.06-0 .16 ), and unvaccinated women, ( 5.8 %; PR, 0.45; 95 % CI, 0.33-0 .61 ), suggesting herd immunity, or protection even among those who did not receive the vaccine. Among 25 - to 29-year - olds, VT prevalence decreased from 8.1 % in 2007 to 5.0 % in 2015 - 2016 ( PR, 0.62; 95 % CI, 0.50-0 .7 ). `` There was evidence of both direct and herd protection from vaccination with prevalence 90 % lower among vaccinated women and 55 % lower among unvaccinated women in 2015 -- 2016 compared with 2007, '' the authors said.

With the return of the Nipah infection in Kerala, the need for awareness about zoonotic diseases has increased, especially in view of the spread of misinformation about these diseases. 
Doctors say that the symptoms of Nipah infection, swine flu and bird flu are similar, but there are also differences in how the diseases impact people and also in their treatment. 

` The basic difference between the Nipah virus and swine flu is that for swine flu drugs and vaccines are available whereas for Nipah there is no treatment or anti viral medication, ' Manoj Sharma, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute in New Delhi told IANS. 

According to the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, the human Nipah virus ( NiV ) infection is a zoonotic disease which was first recognised in a large outbreak of 276 reported cases in Malaysia and Singapore from September 1998 to May 1999. 

In India, during 2001 and 2007 two outbreaks in humans were reported from West Bengal. But in 2018 and 2019, it has affected mainly Kerala. 

` The symptoms of Nipah infection are like flu symptoms -- cough, fever, headache, bodyache, cold and then breathlessness later on, ' said M S Chaudhary, Senior Consultant, Internal medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi. 

` Usually it is the bats which spread Nipah virus. Either one eats bat-infected food, or has close contact with an infected person. So the paramedical staff, very close relatives and all are at risk of contracting the virus, ' Chaudhary added. 

While Nipah is classified as a ` zoonotic ' disease - those that spread from animals to humans -- once a human is infected then it is contagious for other people, said Sharma, adding that Nipah virus can also infect pigs. 

The Nipah virus affects the respiratory and nervous system and patients may experience respiratory failure or neurological failure. But swine flu usually does not lead to neurological problems, Chaudhary said. 

Swine flu was pandemic in 2009 worldwide. Since then there have been sporadic occurrences. So swine flu can spread to any region. 

` It can spread from human to human. It is also seen in pigs. It is a variant of pig influenza virus, ' Sharma said. 

` Symptoms of bird flu are also similar. Bird flu also spreads by infected birds which infect the food and the infection is passed onto humans. There are not too many regions affected by bird flu virus, ' Chaudhary said. 

` The basic thing is to avoid catching the infection. Hand washing and drying of hands is the key to ensure that the infection does not spread, ' Sharma added. 

In the current Nipah outbreak, a Kerala youth has tested positive for the virus, while three nurses who treated him, a friend and another person have been kept in isolation. 

A total of 311 people from Thrissur, Paravur in Ernakulam district, and Thodupuzha in Idukki are also under observation, according to Kerala Health Minister K.K. Shailaja.

Investigational drug for resistant TB gets favorable FDA committee vote. 
An investigational drug to treat highly resistant strains of tuberculosis ( TB ) took another step in the regulatory approval process yesterday. According to a news release from TB Alliance, the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee voted yesterday that there is substantial evidence of the effectiveness and sufficient evidence of the safety of pretomanid as part of a combination treatment for adults with extensively drug-resistant ( XDR ), multidrug-resistant ( MDR ), or treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive TB. The oral regimen, known as BPaL, also includes bedaquiline and linezolid.TB Alliance, which developed pretomanid, submitted a new drug application to the FDA in March and was granted priority review, a designation that speeds up the review process. The committee's 14-4 vote, which is non-binding but will be taken into consideration by the FDA in its evaluation of the drug, was based on a review of safety and efficacy data from 19 clinical studies. Among those was the phase 3 Nix-TB trial, which tested the regimen in patients with XDR-TB and treatment-intolerant or non-responsive MDR-TB. An interim analysis found a favorable outcome in 90 % of patients after 6 months of treatment and 6 months of follow-up. `` We are encouraged by the advisory committee's vote in favor of pretomanid for use in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid for the treatment of highly-resistant forms of TB and we look forward to the FDA's final action, '' Mel Spigelman, MD, president and CEO of TB Alliance, said in the release. The FDA is expected to make a final decision on regulatory approval in August. Jun 6 TB Alliance press release Four new polio cases recorded in 3 countries. 
Three countries recorded four new polio cases total, according to a weekly update today from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ). Afghanistan has a new wild poliovirus type 1 ( WPV1 ) case, Pakistan has two WPV1 cases, and Niger has one circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 ( cVDPV2 ) case. The case-patient in Afghanistan experienced symptom onset on May 8; this is Afghanistan's eighth WPV1 case this year. In Pakistan, onset of paralysis for cases began on May 14 and 19, and the new cases raise the total for 2019 to 21. The GPEI said the case in Niger is genetically linked to the ongoing outbreak of cVDPV2 in Jigawa, Nigeria. The case-patient in Niger experienced an onset of paralysis on Apr 3. This is the first cVCPV2 case reported in Niger in 2019; in 2018, the country saw 10 cases. In addition to the new cases, officials recorded several environmental detections this week, according to the GPEI, including 16 positive WPV1 samples collected in Pakistan and one cVDPV2 sample in Nigeria. The World Health Organization ( WHO ) yesterday also confirmed a positive cVDPV2 sample detected in a hospital in Cameroon on May 23. The sample is linked to the outbreak in Nigeria. `` This event highlights the risk of renewed international spread of cVDPV2 from Nigeria and the rest of the Lake Chad region, given the large-scale population movement; subnational immunity and surveillance gaps across the Lake Chad region, '' the WHO said. Jun 7 GPEI update Jun 6 WHO report CDC warns of tuberculin test shortage. 
The US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said it expects a 3 - to 10-month national shortage of Aplisol tests, manufactured by Par Pharmaceuticals. Aplisol is one of two purified-protein derivative ( PPD ) tuberculin antigens licensed for performing tuberculin skin tests, the CDC said in a Health Alert Network report yesterday. Par Pharmaceuticals notified the CDC that it expects a shortage of 5-milliliter tests in June and of 1-milliliter tests in November. `` The 3 - 10 month timeframe for the nationwide shortage is the manufacturer's current estimate and is subject to change, '' the CDC said. Tuberculin skin tests ( TSTs ) are one of two tests used to detect latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The CDC recommends that clinicians prioritize use of TSTs on patients most at risk for tuberculosis, and also to consider testing for the bacterium with interferon-gamma release assay ( IGRA ) blood tests. Jun 6 CDC report Officials confirm avian flu outbreaks in Mexico, South Africa. 
Highly pathogenic avian flu has struck poultry in Mexico and a commercial ostrich farm in South Africa, according to new World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ) reports posted this week. Mexican officials yesterday confirmed four H7N3 avian flu outbreaks in two backyard flocks and two farms in Guerrero, Queretaro, and Hidalgo states in south central Mexico. The outbreaks, which began from May 8 to May 20, affected backyard flocks of 25 and 54 birds and farms housing 1,300 and 133,566 poultry. Among the four outbreaks the virus killed 1,160 birds, and officials disposed of the surviving poultry to curb further transmission. Officials also established quarantines and restrictions on the movement of poultry in and out of the affected areas. The South African outbreak began on Apr 15 in Eastern Cape province in the south and sickened 22 ostriches on a farm containing 709 birds. It involved highly pathogenic H5N8 strain, and response measures include destroying animal products, by-products, and waste, as well as disinfection.

With the return of the Nipah virus in Kerala, the need for awareness about zoonotic diseases has increased, especially in view of the spread of misinformation about these diseases. Doctors say that the symptoms of Nipah, swine flu and bird flu are similar, but there are also differences in how the diseases impact people and also in their treatment. Nipah virus can be transmitted to humans from animals ( such as bats or pigs ), or contaminated foods and can also be transmitted directly from human-to-human. Fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are the natural host of Nipah virus. Difference between Nipah, swine flu, bird flu'The basic difference between the Nipah virus and swine flu is that drugs and vaccines are available for swine flu whereas, for Nipah, there is no treatment or antiviral medication, ' Manoj Sharma, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute in New Delhi told IANS. About Nipah virus. 
According to the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, the human Nipah virus ( NiV ) infection is a zoonotic disease which was first recognised in a large outbreak of 276 reported cases in Malaysia and Singapore from September 1998 to May 1999. In India, during 2001 and 2007, two outbreaks in humans were reported from West Bengal. But in 2018 and 2019, it has affected mainly Kerala.

Taipei, June 10 ( CNA ) The Council of Agriculture ( COA ) warned Monday of the potential damage that could be caused by crop-destroying fall armyworm, stressing that it is critical to wipe out the harmful insect across Taiwan in the coming two or three weeks. `` It is imperative to stem out all fall armyworms throughout the country, because it could create much more trouble than avian flu, '' COA Deputy Minister Huang Chin-cheng ( 黃金城 ) said at a news conference. The arrival of fall armyworms could reduce the yield of wheat, corn, sorghum and rice crops by 20-30 percent and affect 45 percent of the cultivation of those crops, said Feng Hai-tung ( 馮海東 ), head of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine. As part of government efforts to terminate fall armyworms, 500 traps using pheromones -- chemical substances produced by an animal that affect the behavior of others of its species -- have been installed across the country, he said. Given that an appropriate use of pesticides can help farmers eliminate fall armyworms, which are in fact caterpillars, the COA has recommended 11 specific pesticides, including Neem oil and Bacillus thuningiensis, on its website to achieve the goal, Feng said. The COA issued the warning after a harmful species of Lepidoptera found on a farm in Miaoli County on Saturday was confirmed as the fall armyworm on Monday -- the first such case in Taiwan. Later Monday, the COA's Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute reported that the highly destructive insect seemed to have also appeared in Yilan and Chiayi counties, verification of which will be made public Tuesday. On May 13, the COA held a news conference warning about the possible arrival of the fall armyworm in Taiwan. If the insect arrives in large numbers, sweet corn and rice fields on Taiwan proper and sorghum and wheat fields in Kinmen are vulnerable, and could potentially result in an annual loss of up to NT$ 3.5 billion ( US$ 111.46 million ), according to the COA. Since 2016, the fall armyworm has spread from America to Africa, and from Africa to Asia, including Southeast Asia and India in 2017 - 2018 and China in 2019. According to Chiang Ming-yao ( 江明耀 ), a researcher at the Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute, the latest information shows that 18 provinces in China, including Hainan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, have already reported economic losses as a result of the spread of the ravenous caterpillar.

Taipei ( CNA ) - In the wake of reports from Miaoli Monday, Yilan and Chiayi became the second and third counties in Taiwan to confirm the discovery of crop-destroying fall armyworms, the Council of Agriculture ( COA ) confirmed Wednesday. 
According to Yilan's Agriculture Department, more than 20 worms discovered by a farmer on his organic corn field Monday have been confirmed as the highly destructive fall armyworm. 
The corn was destroyed and buried by the county authorities the same afternoon in an effort to prevent the further spread of the harmful insect pest. 
Later on Wednesday, the fall armyworm was also confirmed by the COA as having been found on a corn field in Chiayi, the crop from which was immediately destroyed and buried. 
Fields within 200 meters of the corn field were sprayed with pesticides in an effort to wipe out the insect pest, a county official said. 
According to the COA, two different types of fall armyworm have been identified, one that primarily attacks corn, the other rice crops. 
Officials said the one that targets corn could have come from China, while the other species might have flown from China or Vietnam. 
Meanwhile, seven additional cases of the insect pest were reported in Yunlin, Chiayi and Yilan counties by late Wednesday, the COA said. 
The fall armyworm was first confirmed to have appeared on a farm in Miaoli County Monday -- the first such case in Taiwan, after a visitor to the farm reported it to the local government. 
`` It is imperative that we stem an all-out invasion by fall armyworms across the country, because they could create much more trouble than avian flu, '' Council of Agriculture ( COA ) Deputy Minister Huang Chin-cheng ( 黃金城 ) said at a news conference Monday. 
The arrival of fall armyworms could reduce the yield of wheat, corn, sorghum and rice crops by 20-30 percent and impact 45 percent of the cultivation of those crops, said Feng Hai-tung ( 馮海東 ), head of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, on the same occasion. 
With officials increasingly concerned about the arrival of the invasive fall armyworm in Taiwan, the COA has installed 500 pheromone traps around the country as part of an effort to eliminate the pest, he said. 
If the fall armyworm arrives in large numbers, sweet corn and rice fields on Taiwan proper and sorghum and wheat fields in Kinmen are particularly vulnerable, with potential annual losses of up to NT$ 3.5 billion ( US$ 111.46 million ), according to the COA. 
Since 2016, the crop-devouring pest has reportedly caused economic losses in America, Africa and Asia that include 18 provinces in China. ( By Flor Wang and Shen Ju-feng )";"EN";2019-06-12 08:50:00;"1 6";

Federal authorities say a 39-year-old Connecticut man has been caught trying to smuggle nearly three dozen live finches through John F. Kennedy Airport in order to sell them for singing competitions. 

Francis Gurahoo was arrested Sunday after arriving on a flight from Georgetown, Guyana. Prosecutors say customs officials found the 34 live birds in his carry-on luggage hidden inside individual plastic hair curlers. 

Gurahoo was arraigned Monday on a charge of unlawful wildlife smuggling. Information on his lawyer was n't immediately available. 

Officials say the finches from Guyana are prized. They are used in singing contests in Brooklyn and Queens where wages are placed on the birds with the best voice. Prosecutors say Gurahoo said he planned to sell them for about $ 3,000 each, for a total haul of over $ 100,000.

`` From an economic perspective, agriculture is our state's top industry, supporting more than a half million jobs and generating more than $ 26 billion in total earnings, '' Causer, chair of the House Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee, said. `` The industry also puts food on our tables. All Pennsylvanians have a vested interest in ensuring our agriculture industry not only survives but thrives and being ready to respond to potential disasters is a vital part of that. '' 
House Bill 1516 would create the Pennsylvania Rapid Response Disaster Readiness Account and allocate funding to the Department of Agriculture to enable a quick response to agricultural disasters. Examples include deploying animal or plant health officials to contain an outbreak or threat and providing an immediate response to foodborne illnesses. 
Currently, the Spotted Lanternfly, an invasive species, is threatening multiple segments of the agriculture industry, including grapes, fruit trees, and hardwoods. It was first discovered in Pennsylvania in Berks County in 2014 and has since spread to more than a dozen counties in the eastern and southcentral regions of the state. 
In 2015, the state was preparing for a potential outbreak of avian influenza as the disease spread across the country in nearly two dozen states. 
`` We have effective monitoring and surveillance systems in place to identify threats like these early on, but we are not as prepared as we could be to act on them, '' Causer said. `` Creating a disaster readiness account will help ensure we have the resources to provide a rapid and well-coordinated response when needed.

Lampung ( ANTARA ) - 
The UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO )'s Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases ( ECTAD ) is working with the Indonesian News Agency, Antara, to explain the nation's media about the challenges related to dealing with the zoonosis in Indonesia. 

FAO ECTAD's Chief Technical Advisor Luuk Schoonman explained that zoonotic diseases, which are diseases transmitted from animals to humans or vice versa, can affect food security and livelihoods of the people. 

`` In fact, half of the 900 million people who are below the poverty line depend on livestock, '' Luuk said at the opening of the 2019 Media Fellowship Program in Lampung on Wednesday. 

Luuk explained that one of the zoonotic diseases, bird flu, was diagnosed in 32 of 34 provinces in Indonesia from 2003 to 2004. This outbreak caused 16.2 million birds to die, and 168 people die with 200 cases of infection on human ( the largest in the world ). 

As a result of efforts by FAO and other agencies, there has been a decline in the number of bird flu cases from 2,751 cases in 2007 to 476 in 2018. Also, FAO has hired more than 3,000 animal health workers in 32 provinces. 

Additionally, FAO collaborates with 11 Faculties of Veterinary Medicine in Indonesia to educate the public about zoonosis. 

On the same occasion, the Senior Journalist from Antara, Priyambodo, as the speaker for popular science coverage and reporting, noted that there are often foreign terms that are difficult to match in journalism. 

`` As the media, we must be able to negotiate with speakers for the use of terms that are easier for readers to understand, '' said Priyambodo. 

There was also a briefing on the material for the Scholarship Program for the Media Fellowship Program 2019, which is to be held on 19 - 21 June 2019.

Angola, Ethiopia, Pakistan report new polio cases. 
Two countries in Africa and Pakistan have recorded new polio cases in the past week, according to an update today from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ). Pakistan has reported two wild poliovirus type 1 ( WPV1 ) cases in Shangla and Bannu districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, with onset of paralysis on May 18 and 24. The cases raise Pakistan's total in 2019 to 24. A circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 ( cVDPV2 ) was confirmed in Angola, in a patient with acute flaccid paralysis ( AFP ) who experienced onset of paralysis on Apr 5. The case-patient lives in Lunda Norte province, which borders the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ). GPEI said DRC has been monitoring cVDPV2 outbreaks since 2017. An AFP patient in Somali province, Ethiopia, also tested positive for cVDPV2. The patient reported an onset of paralysis on May 20. `` Genetic sequencing confirms that the isolated virus is linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak detected in the Horn of Africa in 2018, with cases reported in Somalia as well as from an environmental sample in Kenya, '' the GPEI said. Jun 20 GPEI update CDC ends investigation into 209-case E coli outbreak tied to ground beef. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) announced an end to its investigation of an Escherichia coli O103 outbreak linked to contaminated ground beef. The outbreak resulted in 209 illnesses reported in 10 states -- 13 more cases than in the agency's last update on May 13. No deaths were recorded, but 29 people were hospitalized for their infections. Two cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure, were reported. `` This outbreak appears to be over. Ill people in this outbreak ate ground beef from many sources. No single supplier, distributor, or brand of ground beef was identified, '' the CDC said. On Apr 24, Grant Park Packing of Franklin Park, Illinois, recalled approximately 53,200 pounds of raw ground beef products distributed to restaurants. The day before, K2D Foods, doing business as Colorado Premium Foods in Carrolton, Georgia, recalled 113,424 pounds of ground beef. Patients reported symptom onset from Mar 1 to May 1. Of 159 people interviewed, 125 ( 79 % ) reported eating ground beef in the week prior to illness. Kentucky and Tennessee recorded the most cases, with 76 and 59 cases respectively. Georgia reported 51. Jun 19 CDC update More H5 avian flu confirmed in Namibian penguins, Taiwanese poultry. 
In the latest highly pathogenic avian flu developments with wild birds and poultry, Namibia reported three more detections in penguins and Taiwan reported three more poultry events involving H5N2, according to notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ). Namibia reported its first H5N8 outbreak in February at a penguin breeding site on Halifax Island. Yesterday it reported two others that occurred in February, one on Halifax Island and the other on Ichaboe Island. The third outbreak began on Jun 20 on Mercury Island, another coastal seabird conservation area. Taken together, the outbreaks killed 238 jackass penguins. Officials said the source of the virus is migratory waterfowl. Taiwan's latest H5N2 events are part of outbreaks in poultry that have been under way since 2015. The three outbreaks began between May 27 and Jun 8. One involved discarded dead geese in Yunlin County, a second occurred in native chickens at a slaughterhouse in Taipei City, and the third involved native chickens at a farm in Yunlin County.

Samples taken earlier in the week from the free-range poultry farm in Fangyuan Township were confirmed to be infected with the avian flu virus subtype, the bureau said in a statement. Disinfection and bird flu surveillance and monitoring procedures are being carried out at poultry farms near the infected one, according to BAPHIQ. Poultry farmers are urged to maintain proper ventilation in their facilities and to prevent their birds from coming in contact with wild birds so as to avoid an escalation of avian flu in Taiwan, the bureau said. According to data from the Council of Agriculture, 26 poultry farms in Taiwan have been hit by avian flu so far this year, resulting in the culling of 368,627 birds.
