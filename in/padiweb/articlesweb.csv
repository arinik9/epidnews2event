The VTA is to test foxes hunted or found dead for avian influenza, to get an idea of whether the virus is also being transmitted to mammals in Estonia,"" Sammel added.The ECDC assesses the risk of infection of humans in Europe to be very low, even in the case of those whose work brings them into contact with birds, for instance poultry farmers.--Follow ERR News on Facebook and Twitter and never miss an update!";"EN";"NULL";"2021-06-09 13:15:00.000000";"1 6 24"

The Western Cape provincial department of environmental affairs says it is investigating the issue of dying seals on the coast.Meanwhile at least 16 514 wild birds have also been reported dead in the province. Last year 5 000 seals were found dead in Namibia. The Western Cape Disaster Management Centre says it is aware of reports of seals being found dead on the West Coast.According to the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, the deaths are, however, not linked to avian influenza but malnutrition.The department said 144 seals were buried between Laaiplek and Dwarskersbos, and 50 at Elandsbaai on Tuesday morning. Environmental Affairs MEC Anton Bredell said the provincial government is looking into the deaths which have been occurring over the past weeks.""The dying seals are not linked to the avian influenza outbreak. Rather it appears that the seals are dying due to malnutrition. ""The situation is still being investigated. In addition, we are urging the public not to feed any seals despite the concerns about malnutrition. ""The animals remain wild creatures and must not be made dependent on human interaction for survival,"" Bredell said.READ | Thousands of dead seal pups wash ashore in Namibia, says conservancy groupHe added that the avian influenza crisis in the province was not over, but the number of dying birds was declining. At least 16 514 wild birds have been reported dead, majority being Cape Cormorants.""Yesterday roughly 150 dead birds were found across the province in the affected areas. The bulk of the dead birds were on Dyer island where 122 Cape Cormorants were found.""Bredell said efforts to address the outbreak were continuing and the public is urged to be vigilant and report unusual mortalities in birds to their local municipalities, conservation authorities, the state veterinarian, or even the SPCA and the NSPCA.Last month News24 reported scientists were finding worrying signs of dying seals, a repeat of the 5 000 that were found dead in Namibia a year ago.Dr Tess Gridley, founding director of Sea Search Research and Conservation said: ""We have found animals across all age ranges from aborted pre-term pups, where the females just had the pup and then deserted it straightaway, to sub-adult males literally dying on the rocks.""Gridley said then that the adult seals could be aborting because they were simply too hungry, which mirrored last year's tragic die-off in Namibia, which made global headlines.";"EN";"NULL";"2021-11-02 18:29:26.000000";"1 6 24"

Median patient age was 66.5 years, and two-thirds were men.Thirty-three patients had a history of kidney disease, 26 were previously healthy kidney patients who developed AKI 5 days after ICU admission, and 70 patients had normal kidney function before and during their ICU stay. Thirty-two patients required dialysis.Among the 33 patients with pre-existing kidney disease, 55% survived their ICU stay, compared with 46% of those diagnosed as having AKI and 83% of the patients who maintained normal kidney function.The two groups of patients with impaired kidney dysfunction had significantly lower odds of survival than average, for a higher risk of death than those with normal kidney function. The findings suggest that neither early initiation of dialysis nor the number of days on dialysis had much survival benefit, the authors said.Lead author Katharina Oberneder, MD, of Sigmund Freud University, said the results indicate that kidney dysfunction is a key risk factor for death related to COVID-19 in ICU patients. ""Ultimately, what is most important is focusing on the early diagnosis of acute kidney dysfunction and how we can use these results to improve the care of critically ill COVID-19 patients,"" she said. Dec 17 ESAIC press release H5N1 avian flu found in Estonian fox and water birds in France, Hong KongThree jurisdictions reported highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu in populations other than poultry, including a fox, zoo birds, and wild birds, according to the latest notifications from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).Estonia reported high-pathogenic H5N1 in a dead wild red fox found in Hiiu province on Hiiumaa island off the country's western Baltic coast. Results were confirmed on Nov 24. The report said the animal probably contracted the virus from other wild species.Elsewhere in Europe, France reported H5N1 in pink-backed pelicans at a zoo in Occitanie province in the country's southwest. The zoo keeps birds in both aviaries and in open-air settings, including on a pond, which is close to a wetland. The event began on Dec 14 and killed 3 of 65 susceptible birds.In Asia, Hong Kong reported H5N1 in a black-faced spoonbill found dead on Dec 16 at a wetland park in Yuen Long as part of ongoing surveillance. No detections were found on nearby poultry farms.Dec 17 OIE report on H5N1 in Estonian fox Dec 18 OIE report on H5N1 at French zoo Dec 20 OIE report on H5N1 in Hong Kong";"EN";"NULL";"2021-12-20 19:51:17.000000";"1 6 24"
