	The Rivers State Government said on Tuesday that it had killed hundreds of fowls infected by the Avian Flu in a privately owned farm in Port Harcourt.
The Commissioner for Agriculture, Emma Chinda, said that the farm had been quarantined and decontaminated.
He also said no human infection had been recorded.
“On January 14, we got a report from a farm that was worrisome. The report we got suggested that the farm may have been infected by the highly pathogenic avian influenza.
According to the commissioner, samples of the flu were taken to the Veterinary Research Institute in Vom, Plateau State.
“The result came out on January 17 and it read positive of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
“On the basis of that, we had to take necessary steps. Apart from quarantining the farm, we had to depopulate the birds in the farm to stop further spread”.
“Thereafter, we decontaminated the farm. We are containing the situation because officials of government and experts are on ground monitoring the situation”, he added.
Mr. Chinda said there was no need to panic because government was well equipped to handle the situation.
He said before the outbreak, they received information from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture on avian influenza in Kano and a bird market in Lagos.
“We were very much on alert and when it happened here, we handled the situation’’, he said.

	The Ogun State Government on Monday confirmed that some markets tested positive to the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus, known as Bird Flu. 
The Commissioner for Agriculture, Ronke Sokefun, said this while addressing journalists at her office in Abeokuta, but quickly added that government has put in place measures to contain the spread of the disease.
She also gave assurances to poultry farmers that their birds would be protected against the virus, adding that the ministry had re-activated the Emergency Preparedness Plan for the control and containment of the virus and procured necessary disinfectants.
Mr. Sokefun said surveillance and live bird market decontamination was initiated along border towns of the State.
She explained that Bird Flu is primarily a disease of poultry that causes a great economic loss to poultry, noting that it has the ability to affect human beings if not properly contained.
“I wish to inform you that our officers have been able to contain the disease at the markets and we are on the lookout for more of such outbreaks through the surveillance systems of the Veterinary Department of the Ministry. We are also working closely with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, National Veterinary Research Institute, Poultry Association of Nigeria and others,” Mr. Sokefun said.
The commissioner ascertained that consumption of poultry products is safe if properly cooked, urging poultry farmers to heighten bio-security measures to their farm and report high rate of mortality among their birds.
Speaking earlier, the Director of Veterinary Services, Dotun Sorunke, encouraged poultry farmers to register with the department and patronize registered Veterinary Doctors.
Mr. Sorunke advised members of the public, especially those with backyard poultry farms, to be observant and report any disease and conditions of their poultry.
He asked anyone who needs or wants more information to contact the Ministry through the following numbers: 08033892861, 08025195464, 08027370579, 07034500063.

 An outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N8 has been discovered in Germany, with more than 30,000 birds reportedly susceptible to the disease.
 
 So far there have been 5,000 cases, resulting in 1,880 deaths – equivalent to a 37.60% fatality rate - in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Northern Germany. The bird population affected is a turkey fattening holding in the district of Vorpommern-Greifswald.A report was issued to the World Organisation for Animal Health yesterday (6 November), from the Bundesministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz (BMELV).It also stated that culling had already started and that dead birds were being disposed of safely.It is the first time a case of H5N8 has been reported in the country since March 2009.

The strain of bird flu found on a duck-breeding farm in the UK is the same as the one recently identified in the Netherlands and Germany, the environment department has said.
The culling of 6,000 ducks at the farm in Nafferton, near Driffield, East Yorkshire, where the “highly pathogenic” virus has been found, is under way, according to officials.
A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the disease was the H5N8 strain, the same as the strain confirmed at a chicken farm in the central province of Utrecht, the Netherlands, and in Germany.
But the advice from the chief medical officer and Public Health England remained that the risk to public health from the virus was “very low” and the Food Standards Agency has said there is no food safety risk for consumers, she said.
She said the cull to prevent the potential spread of infection was being carried out in a safe and humane manner by fully-trained staff from the government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency.
“Our response to this outbreak follows tried and tested procedures for dealing with avian flu outbreaks and we expect the cull to be completed later today. Additionally, our animal health laboratory at Weybridge has confirmed that the outbreak of avian influenza in East Yorkshire is the H5N8 strain.
“The advice from the chief medical officer and Public Health England remains that the risk to public health is very low. The Food Standards Agency have said there is no food safety risk for consumers,” the spokeswoman said.
The cull of 6,000 ducks at the farm owned by the UK’s largest producer of duck and duck products, Cherry Valley, comes after the transport of poultry and eggs throughout the Netherlands was banned after the H5N8 outbreak in Utrecht.
Officials have been quick to reassure the public that the strain found at the farm after the alarm was raised by a vet on Friday was not the H5N1 strain of the virus which has led to human deaths, and that the risk to public health from the outbreak remained very low.
But experts have warned further outbreaks could emerge in the coming days.
Officials are investigating how the virus reached East Yorkshire, whether it could have be the result of commercial transport of birds, or carried by wild birds which are also affected by bird flu.
The East Yorkshire outbreak is the first serious case of bird flu since 2008, when the H7N7 strand was found in free-range laying hens near Banbury, Oxfordshire.
Most types of bird flu are harmless to humans but two types, H5N1 and H7N9, have caused serious concerns.
Chief veterinary officer Nigel Gibbens said the Cherry Valley farm at the centre of the alert had good biosecurity in place, and as a result the risk of spread was “probably quite low”, he said. But he warned more cases could follow and, because of the risk of wild birds spreading the disease, urged farmers and their vets all over the country to be alert to the possibility of disease.
Keith Warner, president of the British Veterinary Poultry Association, also said that while previous outbreaks of bird flu had been controlled on one or two isolated farms, there could be more incidents in the latest outbreak.
“Everybody in the UK that owns birds in any number should be on biosecurity lockdown,” he urged, advising no unnecessary visits to farms, transport or sharing of equipment, and that free-range birds in the restriction zone should be kept inside.
Paul Bellotti, head of housing, transportation and public protection at East Riding of Yorkshire council, said staff would be stationed across the six-mile (10km) surveillance zone and the two-mile protection zone immediately around the farm to provide advice and guidance and gather important data.
“By the close of play today, every registered poultry farm will be visited within the 3km protection zone and a 10km surveillance zone, as well as other smaller non-registered poultry and bird-keeping premises that we become aware of during the course of the day,” he said. “Residents should not be concerned by the visits being undertaken by our officers and we would ask that they provide any and all assistance, if requested.
“The council would like to once again state that the risk to public health is very low and would also like to reassure residents that poultry and eggs are safe to purchase and eat, subject to normal food preparation. Motorists and the travelling public should continue to use any and all routes on the highways network, unless they are advised otherwise, and, unless specifically closed, public footpaths remain open.”
The British Poultry Council said: “Defra confirmed this afternoon that the strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) found on a duck breeding farm in Yorkshire is of the H5N8 strain, which is a very low risk to human health and no risk to the food chain. Work is now under way to understand the route of the infection.
“The exclusion zones around the farm, at 3km (protection zone) and at 10km (surveillance zone), remain in place. Across the country a high level of surveillance of housed and wild birds is continuing.”

We’ve already seen the H5N8 virus show up this fall in Korea, China, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK – both in domesticated poultry, and in wild or migratory birds.
Compared to other avian flu viruses we’ve followed over the past decade, this one seems to be spreading geographically at a very rapid rate.
The good news, is that so far there have been no documented human infections with H5N8, and so this virus remains primarily a threat to wild birds and poultry operations.

 Avian flu is an infectious viral disease of birds. Most bird flu viruses do not infect humans, but some have caused serious infections in humans.Two strains of avian influenza - H5N2 and H5N8 - have been confirmed in wild birds in Washington state, near the U.S. border with Canada, but there was no immediate cause for public health concerns, U.S. agriculture officials said on Wednesday.
 
 Neither virus has been found in U.S. commercial poultry.South Korea's imports from the United States in the first 11 months of the year included 63,245 tonnes of poultry meat and 264,000 chicks, according to ministry data.

	The United States has taken issue with South Korea's decision to ban imports of U.S. poultry following the discovery of highly pathogenic bird flu cases in Washington and Oregon, the Seoul government said Thursday.In December, South Korea banned imports of all poultry products from America after two wild birds were determined to have contracted the highly pathogenic avian influenza.According to Seoul's trade and industry ministry, the United States Trade Representative said in its latest trade barriers report that the import ban conflicts with directives issued by the World Organization for Animal Health.The Paris-based organization said import bans should be implemented on products from regions reporting HPAI and not a blanket ban for all meat from a country.The USTR claims South Korea's farm-related safety standards lack transparency and predictability, arguing that there have been persistent delays by the Seoul government in authorizing trade of new food products, according to the ministry.Besides poultry, the representative office said Seoul's revised automobile management act, which makes it mandatory for import cars to disclose previous repair records, unfairly hurt foreign-made brands.The USTR also said that ambiguity in the sending of local financial data abroad and delays in getting authorization for such transfers have caused many U.S. firms to express frustration.Washington, however, said that South Korea was adhering faithfully to agreements reached on the import of beef from animals less than 30 month old, according to the ministry.

SOUTH KOREA - The Korean government is in the midst of trying to contain the spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI, H5N8 type) among its poultry farms. As of now, HPAI is confirmed in three farms located in North Jolla Province, located in the southwest side of the Korean peninsula. Prior to this incident, Korea’s last reported HPAI outbreak was 16 May 2011. This recent case will suspend all poultry exports from Korea until it can regain OIE status as being free from HPAI. 
The first report of a suspected case of HPAI was reported on 16 January 2014 by a duck breeding farm located in Gochang-gun, North Jolla Province. The case was confirmed as HPAI (H5N8) on 18 January 2014. This type of HPAI represents the first time that it was found in Korea, as all previous cases (2003-2004, 2006-2007, 2008, and 2010-2011) were of H5N1 type. 
Presently, there are no known cases of human beings being infected by H5N8 type of HPAI. According to the initial epidemiological investigation, the farm shipped ducklings to 24 duck farms located in 4 different provinces (a total of 173,000 ducklings) within the AI incubation period (a maximum of 21 days). 
The truck that shipped ducklings to these farms also stopped by a slaughter plant after unloading the ducklings. The Korean government sent officials to all of the affected farms and the slaughter plant, stopped movement of ducks from these farms and conducted fumigation. The slaughter plant is temporarily shut down. 
As for the farms where the confirmed case was found, the Korean government culled all of 21,000 heads on the farms. The government will also cull all of the poultry (four duck farms, 62,000 birds) located within a radius of 500 meters (about 547 yards) from the infected farm. It will also cull a poultry farm owned by the duck breeding farm located about 3 km away as a preventive measure. 
On 16 January, a second suspected case of HPAI was reported by a duck farm located in Buhahn, North Jolla Province. The second farm is located 10.3 km (6.4 miles) away from the first farm in Gochang-gun, where HPAI was first confirmed. The birds being raised in 6 farms (90,000 birds) located within a radius of 500 meters from the second farm were also culled. This was also confirmed as H5N8 type HPAI on 19 January. 
The Korean government also found around 100 dead migrant birds in a water reservoir located between the two farms. These birds were also confirmed as having been infected by HPAI (H5N8) on January 20. As a result, the Korean government assumes that the source of the HPAI confirmed in the duck farms came from the migrant birds. 
On 18 January, a third case of HPAI was reported by a duck farm located 1.3 km (0.8 mile) south of the second farm in Buhahn. This was also confirmed as HPAI (H5N8) on 20 January. 
In order to prevent any further spread of HPAI, the government announced a temporary suspension of all poultry movements within North and South Jolla province and Gwangju city for 48 hours from 00:00 hours on 19 January to midnight on 20 January. As no further cases were reported, the Korean government lifted the temporary suspension as of midnight 20 January. 
A fourth suspected case of HPAI was reported on 21 January by a duck farm located in Gochang-gun, North Jolla Province. This farm is located 19 km (11.8 miles) away from the first farm. The fourth farm is owned by the same owner as the second farm located in Buhahn and compound feed trucks had moved back and forth between the two farms. A final confirmatory test result is expected on 23 January.

 South Korea says migratory birds were the likely cause of the country’s first outbreak of bird flu in three years, and stepped up quarantine measures at domestic poultry farms to stop the spread of the disease.
European Pressphoto Agency
A quarantine vehicle sprayed disinfectant on Daedong Lake in South Jeolla Province, South Korea, Jan. 19 after the discovery of dead migratory birds in a reservoir in North Jeolla Province.
Tests showed the remains of 100 dead migratory wild ducks in a local reservoir contained H5N8 avian influenza virus, the same strain found at poultry farms in North Jeolla Province near the reservoir, the agriculture ministry said in a statement.
“The wild migratory birds were presumably the very likely source of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that had affected the duck farms in Gochang and Buan [in North Jeolla Province,]” about 300 kilometers (187 miles) and 280 kilometers southwest of Seoul respectively, the ministry said in a statement.Advertisement 
The ministry identified the migratory birds as the Baikal Teal (Anas formosa), a wild duck that breeds in eastern Russia and spends the winter in East Asia. They usually visit Korea from October through March.
The ministry said the government was closely monitoring migratory birds at their resting places, which include reservoirs, rivers and paddy fields, and was also restricting people from visiting those areas for activities such as hunting or sightseeing.
Since the outbreak was reported last week, Korean authorities have culled more than 90,000 ducks at six poultry farms–two farms that had poultry that tested positive for avian influenza, and another four nearby.
Another slaughter was underway at a third duck farm in Buan, which reported a suspected case of bird flu, authorities said Monday.
In a bid to contain the possible spread of the disease, the ministry has imposed a temporary ban on poultry shipments from North Jeolla Province, as well as neighboring Gwangju City and South Jeolla Province.
South Korea doesn’t have any listed poultry farmers, but shares of packaged chicken processers fell for a second consecutive session on Monday. Harim Holdings Co. was down 5.4% and Maniker Co. was 2.6% lower in early afternoon trade, underperforming the benchmark Kospi index’s 0.5% gain.
The previous outbreak of bird flu in South Korea was from December 2010 through May 2011, during which authorities culled 6.5 million poultry. Unlike neighboring countries including China, there has been no human case of bird flu in South Korea.

Approximately 30,000 hens are being culled in Barneveld, Gelderland after avian influenza was detected at a poultry farm there, the government revealed in a statement. Further analysis by Central Veterinary Institute (CVI), expected to be available on Friday, will determine the severity of the flu, but for now it is suspected to be a mild H7 variant, Secretary of Economic Affairs Sharon Dijksma writes in a letter to the Tweede Kamer. 
Since the mild, low pathogenic H7 variant can mutate into a more pathogenic variant, becoming highly contagious and deadly for chickens, the farm was cleared as soon as possible.
Beginning Thursday afternoon, a ban on transporting eggs, poultry, poultry manure and used bedding was issued for a one-kilometer radius around the infected farm. There are 17 poultry farms within this area which are sampled and tested for avian influenza.
Every farm in the area has to keep birds locked indoors for three weeks, measures similar to those first put in place last year as avian influenza was detected in the Netherlands. Safety measures were finally reduced in February.

	MANILA – The Philippines has barred the entry of poultry from Vietnam and two European countries.
In separate orders, Secretary Proceso Alcala directed Department of Agriculture (DA) personnel to halt the processing of applications to import poultry from Italy, the Netherlands and Vietnam.
The ban covers domestic and wild birds, including poultry meat, day-old chicks, eggs and semen.
The import ban comes on the heels of reports from the Office Internationale Des Epizooties (OIE) of outbreaks of highly pathogenic Avian Influenza virus serotype H5 in Vinh Long and Trah Vinh in Vietnam; and highly pathogenic Avian Influenza virus serotype H5N8 in Veneto, Italy; and Ter Aar, Zuid-Holland, Kamperveen and Utrecht City in the Netherlands.
""We want to protect our local bird population and ensure the safety of consumers,"" Alcala said, adding that the Philippines is the only Southeast Asian country free from bird flu.
He ordered all quarantine personnel to seize shipments of poultry products from the four countries.

RUSSIA - There has been two outbreaks of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in poultry reported in the Altai Kray region in Siberia in central Russia. The outbreak has affected 326 domestic ducks, geese and chickens which were located in small villages.  
As a result 322 birds died and the remaining animals were destroyed.  
The source of the outbreak is thought to be contact with wild species, Probably, hunted ducks and geese trophies had been placed in backyards where mortality occurred later in domestic birds.

 South Korea has announced a 36-hour lockdown over the weekend on poultry and livestock farms across the country to curb the spread of two highly contagious animal diseases—foot and mouth and bird flu
 South Korea on Thursday announced a 36-hour lockdown over the weekend on poultry and livestock farms across the country to curb the spread of two highly contagious animal diseases—foot and mouth and bird flu.
 
	 
	 The agriculture ministry said the movement of animals, people and vehicles at thousands of farms would be banned from 6:00 am (2100 GMT) on Saturday for disinfection. 
A series of outbreaks of foot-and-mouth in recent months have resulted in the slaughter of around 25,000 pigs, and concern has grown as cases have spread to farms close to the capital Seoul. 
The first cases were detected in July, only two months after South Korea was declared free of the disease at a meeting of the World Organisation for Animal Health in Paris. 
Last week, the agriculture ministry confirmed a case of foot-and-mouth in a cow, the first involving cattle in nearly four years. 
In 2011 a devastating foot-and-mouth outbreak hit the entire Korean peninsula and resulted in the culling of nearly 3.5 million cattle, pigs and other animals in South Korea alone. 
The Seoul government estimated the cost of that outbreak at $2.6 billion. 
Foot-and-mouth disease affects cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, pigs, deer, goats and sheep. 
The battle to contain foot-and-mouth has coincided with outbreaks of avian flu in poultry farms which have resulted in the culling of more than 500,000 birds in the past four months.

Culling and disinfection will be carried out under the authority of Defra and the APHA at the farm near Driffield, East Yorkshire. ""Defra has placed two exclusion zones around the farm, at 3km (protection zone) and at 10km (surveillance zone), following the requirements of the Avian Influenza order 2006. Avian influenza is a disease of birds and the risk to the general public is judged by health experts to be negligible. ""We are working closely with Defra and other agencies and are confident that the controls in place are proportionate to the risks involved. We will be continuing our vigilance over the coming days and, like all poultry producers in the area, will be working with the authorities in the ongoing surveillance programme."" Cherry Valley, which is based in Caistor, near Market Rasen, Lincs., has ""operational centres"" in Britain, China and Germany. According to the firm's website, China is ""home to 2.8 billion Cherry Valley ducks"". The firm rears seven million Pekin ducks in the UK every year, which are mostly sold to the Chinese catering market in the UK and Europe. It has emerged that Christmas turkey suppliers could be at risk from the bird flu outbreak. The risk to humans from the outbreak is virtually non-existent, experts have said, but if the disease spreads to turkey farms, it could lead to a shortage for Christmas. There are a number of turkey farms near to the outbreak. David Evans, Professor of Virology at the University of Warwick said; “Whilst the case in Yorkshire affects ducks the strains of bird ‘flu are transmissible to other domestic and wild poultry, including chickens and turkeys.” Chief veterinary officer Nigel Gibbens said more cases could follow and farmers have been alerted to the danger. ""We cannot rule out that there might be further cases; this is why we put premises under restriction to look for further spread,” he told the BBC. ""Because there's a wild bird risk we also need farmers and their vets all over the country to be alert to possible disease in their farm that they can't explain, draw those to our attention so we can investigate quickly, and, if there is any more disease, seek to nip that in the bud as well."" The farm at the centre of the alert, which has not been identified, has good bio-security in place so the risk of spread is ""probably quite low"". Gary Lavis, chair of the Driffield Parish Council, said a problem was first noticed around a week ago when egg production began dropping and the number of birds dying increased. He said the manager of the farm did not know how the virus had infected the birds. ""They noticed symptoms themselves about one week ago: a drop-off in egg production and slightly higher mortality rates. That alerted them to do some testing,"" he said. ""They're doing their normal routine with suits and masks and the disinfectant they are using is Defra-approved for all strains of bird flu."" The bird flu outbreak in the UK – in 60 seconds Mr Lavis said he was particularly concerned about the potential effect on the local wild bird population, with a mere in Nafferton and an RSPB reserve nearby. He said there were also two battery farms in the area and a number of hobby farmers who keep chickens. ""We're also concerned about the environmental impact. We have a large wildfowl population on the mere, which is a focal point of the village."" A cull of all 6,000 birds at the Yorkshire farm is taking place and a 10km exclusion zone has been thrown up in the area to prevent poultry and waste being transferred. Bird flu, or avian flu, is an infectious viral illness that spreads among birds. In rare cases it can affect humans. Two types have caused serious concern in recent years. These are the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. Other bird flu viruses (particularly H7N7 and H9N2) have also infected people, but these have rarely caused severe illness. Although these viruses don't infect people easily and are usually not transmitted from human to human, several people have been infected around the world, leading to a number of deaths. Prof Wendy Barclay, Chair in Influenza Virology, Imperial College London, said: ""Only a small subset of avian influenza viruses infect humans, and these viruses can be of low or high pathogenicity in the birds. ""Even low pathogenicity bird viruses can cause severe disease in humans like the H7N9 recently identified in China. In previous outbreaks of H5 viruses in the UK, no humans have been infected. Without undergoing further mutations these infections do not pass from person to person. ""Because influenza viruses can mutate readily, it will be important over the coming weeks to maintain vigilant surveillance and monitor any new viruses found for changes. ""Overall this new twist underscores the extant threat that avian influenza viruses pose to our agriculture and to humans."" However Professor Andrew Easton, Professor of Virology at the University of Warwick said the risk to humans was ‘very small or non-existent.’ “We do not yet know what strain of avian flu has been detected though H5N1 that carries risks to humans seems to have been ruled out. “Aquatic birds such as ducks can harbour over 100 (in fact 144 ) different types of influenza. In these birds the viruses do not usually cause disease but when certain types spread to domestic poultry, such as chickens, serious disease can be seen. “It is the types that cause serious disease that are of particular concern. “Human infections with flu strains that infect birds are not common and have been restricted to only a very small number so the risk to humans from this incident is likely to be very small or non-existent. “However, the risk to the poultry industry is high and the current measures require that infected birds are killed as quickly as possible to stop spread to other flocks.”Professor Easton warned that the flu may impact wild bird populations. “There is always concern that some strains of flu may be spread by wild birds and surveillance measures are also likely to be introduced in surrounding areas to check for the possibility of spread,” he added.

131;134;131;China bans U.S. poultry imports on avian flu concerns;http://farmfutures.com/story-china-bans-poultry-imports-avian-flu-concerns-0-122749;" 
 The Chinese government has banned all imports of U.S. poultry and eggs on reports of backyard and wild birds in the Pacific Northwest infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza, the USA Poultry &amp; Egg Export Council said Tuesday. 
Related: New Bird Flu Strain Prompts Call for Prevention Efforts 
The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and the General Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine imposed the ban on imports of processed and unprocessed U.S. poultry and eggs, live chicks and hatching eggs. It was effective Jan. 8. 
A highly pathogenic strain of H5N8 influenza was detected in December in wild birds and in a backyard flock of guinea hens and chickens in Oregon, along with separate H5N2 HPAI detections in wild birds in California and Washington State.Ag groups say China's U.S. poultry ban on bird flu concerns creates trade issue and hurts American poultry producers 
According to USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the influenza virus has not been found in any commercial poultry flock in the U.S. 
China is a key export market for U.S. chicken, turkey and duck products. From January through November last year, U.S. exports to China reached more than $272 million. 
""There's absolutely no justification for China to take such a drastic action,"" said Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry &amp; Egg Export Council. ""In fact, these isolated and remote incidents are hundreds if not thousands of miles away from major poultry and egg production areas. 
""Most all of our other trading partners have taken some sort of regionalized approach, and have limited their restrictions to the state or, in some cases, to the county,"" he said. ""We would have expected China to do the same."" 
China's nationwide restrictions could also have a negative impact on its domestic poultry industry, Sumner said. ""Since the ban also includes U.S. breeding stock, China is cutting off its industry's main source of hatching eggs and chicks, which will curtail the industry's ability to replenish and maintain its production."" 
American Farm Bureau President Bob Stallman said AFBF was in the process of reaching out to the U.S. Trade Representative and the USDA and ""will support their actions to correct this situation as quickly as possible."" 
Related: Avian Flu Will Have Notable Impact on Poultry Trade: Report 
USDA already said it opposes some countries' efforts to limit U.S. poultry imports, noting that limitations violate World Animal Health Organization (OIE) standards. Stallman explained the issue further: 
""Under guidelines from the World Organization for Animal Health, countries are allowed to place trade restrictions only on those geographic regions of concern, not an entire nation,"" Stallman said. ""Avian influenza has been found in non-commercial locations among wild birds in some areas of Oregon and Washington State. China's restriction against all U.S. poultry and eggs is simply unwarranted."" 
USDA reminds consumers that no human cases with these viruses have been detected in the United States, Canada or internationally, and there is no immediate public health concern as a result of these detections.

CHINA - A total of 51 positive findings of five subtypes of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) have been reported and confirmed across China. The Chinese veterinary authority reported all the outbreaks to the World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE) on 24 October. All outbreaks were reported as starting on 12 September and subsequently resolved, presumably because of a national campaign for surveillance testing on that day. 
Each report describes the finding of a different viral subtype. 
One Immediate Notification outlines 16 outbreaks of 'clicncal disease' casued by HPAI strain H5N1 detected in ducks, geese and chickens located in markets across China in the provinces of Guangxi, Qinghai, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Hunan and Jiangsu. There was a total of 18 virus-positive tests. 
 
 
Cases of H5N1 across China  
 
A second Immediate Notification describes a subclinical case HPAI strain H5N3 in a duck sample in Hunan province. 
 
Case of H5N3 in Changsha 
 
The third Immediate Notification was for HPAI strain H5N8 in Panjin in Liaoning province. One positive sample was from a duck in a slaughterhouse and a second one in nearby wetlands. 
 
H5N8 reported in Panjin 
 
A total of 24 outbreaks of clinical disease caused by HPAI strain H5N6 have been reported and confirmed in a Follow Up Report No. 2. The positive samples were obtained at markets and on one farm affecting ducks, geese and chickens in the provinces of Zheijiang, Hunan, Hebei, Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Chingking, Guanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Tibet and Hubei. One outbreak at Heilongjiang involved two positive tests in a flock of 1,421 birds, all of which were destroyed. 
The only previous outbreak of this virus type was on 23 August in Heilongjiang. 
 
H5N6 reported across China 
 
The fifth report from China dated 24 October is a Follow Up Report No.3, which outlines eight outbreaks of clinical disease caused by HPAI strain H5N2 detected in chickens and ducks. Six of these were from markets in Hubei, Guangxi, Liaoning,and Tibet, while two were presumably on farms. A total of 2,333 birds were destroyed after two of them were found to be positive for the virus in Heilongjiang province and in Ningxia, 3,920 birds were destroyed after four of them tested positive.

The farms are in Changhua, Yunlin, Chiayi, and Pingtung counties and the cities of Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Taichung. Officials said 52 of the farms also were affected by HPAI H5N2 viruses.There were 56,178 H5N8 cases, with 56,075 deaths, among 365,591 susceptible birds. Plans call for destroying all the surviving birds to stop the outbreak; more than 92,000 had been culled at the time of the report.Movement restrictions have been imposed at the affected farms, which will be cleaned and disinfected after culling is completed, the report said. Farms within 3 kilometers of the outbreak sites will be under surveillance for 3 months.In a separate OIE report yesterday, Taiwan officials told of H5N2 outbreaks on 86 poultry farms in six of the same areas hit by H5N8: Changhua, Yunlin, Chiayi, and Pingtung counties and the cities of Taichung and Tainan.The virus infected and killed 102,260 of 639,304 susceptible birds, officials said. About 102,000 of the surviving birds have already been culled, and the rest will be destroyed as well. Other planned response measures will be the same as for the farms hit by H5N8.And in a third OIE report yesterday, Taiwan officials said HPAI H5N3 surfaced at three goose farms in Pingtung county. Two of these were also affected by H5N2 outbreaks.The report said the virus killed 4,311 of 11,200 susceptible geese, and plans call for culling the rest and implementing other response measures like those in the H5N8 outbreaks.Events in China and IndiaElsewhere, China today reported HAPI H5N6 and H5N2 outbreaks at separate locations in its eastern province of Jiangsu.H5N6 struck a goose farm in the city of Suzhou, causing 1,185 cases and 582 deaths among 19,284 birds, Chinese officials told the OIE. The rest of the birds were culled. Officials also planned to restrict poultry movements and disinfect the farm. China and Vietnam have reported several H5N6 outbreaks in the past year.The H5N2 eruption involved a farm in the city of Taizhou, causing 1,616 fatal cases among 40,896 birds of unnamed kinds, Chinese officials said in another OIE report. The rest of the birds have already been destroyed, and officials vowed to take other additional control steps as in the H5N6 outbreak.In India, meanwhile, H5N1 struck a turkey farm at Kollam in Kerala state, near the country's southern tip, according to a report filed with the OIE yesterday by Indian officials. They cited 1,628 fatal cases among 10,513 turkeys and said most of the surviving birds have been culled.Several H5N1 outbreaks were reported in duck flocks in Kerala state in late November and early December of 2014.H5N1 in Bulgaria, NigeriaIn Bulgaria, meanwhile, officials told the OIE yesterday that a Dalmatian pelican which was found dead on Jan 22 in the southeastern city of Burgas was infected with HPAI H5N1. A dead black-headed gull that was found with the pelican tested negative for the virus.The birds were collected and tested under an ongoing surveillance program. The report said the detection marked the first H5N1 discovery in the country since June 2010.And in Nigeria, a senior official said today that H5N1 outbreaks have spread to four more states since Jan 21, bringing the recent total to 11, according to a Reuters story today.Nigeria has reported 15 separate outbreaks to the OIE in the past few days. It wasn't immediately clear if today's comments by Akinwumi Adesina, agriculture and rural development minister, represented any outbreaks not yet reported to the OIE.The affected states are Kano, Lagos, Ogun, Rivers, Delta, Edo, Plateau, Gombe, Imo, Oyo, and Jigawa, the story said.

Health authorities also reported Taiwan's first documented case of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8, found in a flock of geese in Chiayi County.	The viruses have not yet been detected in the local human population and can be wiped out entirely by cooking eggs and waterfowl to 70 degrees Celsius or above.Lab Results	The results are the first to arrive from lab tests conducted by the Council of Agriculture's (COA) Animal Health Research Institute (畜衛所).	Since Jan. 8, operators at one duck farm and 23 goose farms across Chiayi, Pingtung, Yunlin and Tainan have sent in samples for testing.	In a report released yesterday, the COA said the H5N8 bird flu virus in Chiayi closely matches a strain detected in South Korea last year.	The H5N2 found in Yunlin and Pingtung counties is unlike all previous variants of H5N2, according to the COA.	Its H5 genome sequence is similar to the South Korean case, while the N2 most resembles a virus reported in China's Jilin province in 2011.	The two viruses were most likely transmitted by migratory birds, according to COA Minister Chen Bao-ji (陳保基).	The COA yesterday ordered a two-day national halt on commercial slaughter of domestic waterfowl, effective until Jan. 14 at noon.	During this time, no waterfowl may be transported between slaughterhouses and all transport vehicles, cages, feedlots are to be disinfected.Culling Begins	Later yesterday, local health authorities began culling waterfowl at confirmed outbreak sites in Yunlin, Pingtung and Chiayi.	Yunlin has 407 goose farms, 11 of which have sent in samples for laboratory checks, said Liao Pei-chih (廖培志), head of Yunlin County's Animal and Plant Disease Control Center (動植物防疫所).	Officials will destroy over 6,000 geese at the four affected farms, which will then be disinfected and quarantined in adherence to the standard operating procedure, Liao said.	In Wandan Township (萬丹), Pingtung, county authorities culled 7,000 ducks at a farm owned by an operator surnamed Lee.	Lee told local media that the outbreak is the first on his farm in 60 years.	Damages from the virus are estimated at NT$2 million to NT$3 million, but the government has no compensation program in place, he said.	The Pingtung County government responded yesterday that it will establish a review board to consider compensation, which will likely be 60 to 70 percent of the average market price.;2015-01-11;80;;;

The number of geese affected surpassed the number of geese raised in Taiwan in the fourth quarter, bureau statistics showed. 	Chen Chih-hsiung (陳智雄), an official with the COA's Department of Animal Industry, said the COA previously studied the possibility of halving the import duty (25 percent) on goose meat to bolster supplies. 	But Hungary, a major goose producer, also reported an outbreak of H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza last month. 	This prompted the government to seek other sources of goose meat, and the possibility that Taiwan will look toward other types of meat this summer to bridge the shortfall cannot be ruled out, Chen said. 	A total of 868 poultry farms around Taiwan have tested positive for avian influenza since the outbreak began in mid-January, which has led to the culling of 4,290,967 geese, chickens and ducks at 863 poultry farms to date.

Today’s new cases lift the number reported in the second wave to 137, topping the 136 cases reported during the first wave last spring. The country’s agriculture ministry also downplayed the role of poultry in spreading the disease based on its surveillance results, raising questions about whether the techniques used are the best for gauging infection levels in flocks. A US expert, however, questioned the testing methods Chinese officials are using, saying they could easily miss H7N9 in poultry.
Six cases from three provinces
The six new H7N9 infections are all in adults from three provinces that have reported several cases already. According to provincial ministry statements translated and posted by the Avian Flu Diary (AFD) blog, they include four from Zhejiang province: a 75-year-woman who is in critical condition, a 76-year-old man who is in severe condition, a 78-year-old man who is in critical condition, and 64-year-old man who is in critical condition.Guangdong province reported one new case-patient, a 67-year-old woman who died on Jan 28 from her illness, and it reported the death of a previously announced case, according to the AFD report. In addition, Jiangsu province announced that tests detected the virus in a 75-year-old woman who is hospitalized in critical condition. China’s latest H7N9 cases boost the outbreak total to 273, according to a case list compiled by the FluTrackers infectious disease message board. Also, cases in the second wave are piling up faster than during the first wave. The first wave reached 136 cases in 158 days, according to a CIDRAP analysis of illness-onset dates. But it took the second wave, which began in early October, to reach the same number of cases in only 105 days. And the pace in the past few weeks has been especially brisk. The two new deaths reported today raise the outbreak’s unofficial fatality count to 60. WHO updateIn related developments, the World Health Organization (WHO) provided details on 15 case reports from China that it received yesterday. Ten involve women and five involve men. All patients are adults, with ages ranging from 31 to 81. Nine of the cases are from Zhejiang province, four are from Guangdong, and single cases were reported from Jiangsu province and Shanghai. Thirteen of the patients are hospitalized in critical or serious condition.All but one of the patients had been exposed to live poultry or a market environment before getting sick. Five of the patients are farmers, and one works as a cook. Questions raised about China’s poultry surveillance
Despite the reports that many patients in both waves of the outbreak were exposed to poultry or their environments, China’s agriculture ministry today downplayed the connection between poultry and human illnesses. An official from China’s agriculture ministry said that so far there is no proof of direct H7N9 transmission from poultry to humans, according to a report from CCTV News, the English language news channel of China Central Television, based in Beijing. Zhang Zhongqiu, the ministry’s bureau director, said so far this year only 8 of 33,000 samples were positive for the virus, and all were from live-poultry markets. A similar pattern was seen during poultry testing last spring in the wake of the first wave of human infections, a puzzling aspect of the outbreak, especially when human H7N9 illnesses in disease hot spots dropped soon after poultry markets were shuttered. Dave Halvorson, DVM, an avian health expert at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul, told CIDRAP News that media reports describing China’s poultry testing techniques raise questions about their effectiveness.He said a ProMED Mail post on a recent report from China’s agriculture ministry to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) suggests that Chinese scientists are using polymerase chain reaction and viral isolation testing to monitor poultry. ProMED Mail is the Internet reporting service of the International Society for Infectious Diseases. He said the surveillance method they are using has little value, because the low-pathogenic virus causes few if any signs in poultry. ""It's akin to looking for human influenza virus by sampling clinically healthy people—you won't find much virus.""""I call this type of surveillance '‘looking for negatives,' because the probability of finding virus in healthy birds is so low,"" Halvorson said.Because low-pathogenic viruses don’t typically make poultry sick, the most effective method is active serologic monitoring, he said. In contrast, passive surveillance for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses is highly effective, because of severe illness in affected poultry. On Jan 16, Hong Kong's government announced that it had reached an agreement with mainland officials on an H7 serology testing program for mainland farms that supply poultry to Hong Kong. The program began on Jan 24 and will also apply to local poultry farms in Hong Kong, according to a government statement. It said tests add another surveillance measure to the already tight systems in place to prevent the introduction of H7N9 to Hong Kong flocks. Hong Kong announced the serology testing program for poultry a few days before other tests found H7N9 in poultry from a certified farm in the mainland’s Guangdong province that had been brought into a Hong Kong wholesale market. The findings triggered the closure of the live-poultry market for 3 weeks and the culling of more than 20,000 birds at the site. Studies shed light on airway attachment, lab capacityIn H7N9 research developments, an international team based at Erasmus University in the Netherlands compared H7N9 virus airway attachment in different animal models and humans and found that the pattern in macaques, mice, and to some extent pigs and guinea pigs resembles that in humans. The team published its findings yesterday online in the Journal of Virology.The attachment for those animals was more similar to humans than the pattern they saw in ferrets. They wrote that the findings shed more light on different animal models for influenza. Meanwhile, a review of the capacity of European labs to detect the H7N9 virus found that 27 of 29 countries said that their generic influenza A detection assays will correctly detect the new virus, according to a report in today’s issue of Eurosurveillance. Overall, 28 of 31 labs in those 27 countries reported having the ability to subtype H7 viruses, with the remaining 3 labs proposing to send their non-subtypeable viruses to a WHO in London.
The survey also found that 22 countries have containment facilities that are appropriate for isolating and propagating the H7N9 virus. Those and other findings suggest that the European Reference Laboratory Network for Human Influenza (ERLI-Net) has quickly adopted good capabilities to detect H7N9 viruses.See also:Jan 30 AFD postFluTrackers human H7N9 case listJan 30 WHO statementJan 28 ProMed Mail postJan 16 Hong Kong government statementJan 29 J Virol abstractJan 30 Eurosurveill report";2014-01-30;137;;;

The first report announced seven cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) illness, while the second announced an additional 16 bird flu cases. The 23 new cases include one patient death. Photo by Lam Yik Fei/Getty Images
According to health news site Healio, the latest cases bring the total in this outbreak of avian flu to 203, with 53 patient deaths. The Jan 20 announcements from WHO increased the number of known cases by 13 percent. Most of the new patients diagnosed with H7N9 illnesses had a history of exposure to poultry or poultry markets.
Avian influenza A (H7N9) was first reported in humans in March 2013, in China, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The illness has also been reported from Taiwan. At this time, human-to-human spread of the illness has not been demonstrated but not all patients have been fully evaluated for the origin of their illness.
Influenza is common in birds. It rarely makes the leap to humans, but the H7 variant has been known to cause small outbreaks. In 2003, an outbreak from an A(H7N7) virus in the Netherlands caused several cases of conjunctivitis.
A more well-known avian influenza outbreak is that of A(H5N1). Known as the ""highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1) virus infection"", the CDC on Jan. 8, 2014 reported about 600 cases from 15 countries since Nov. 2003. Most cases were due to exposure to poultry, but several clusters of human-to-human transmission have been documented. The illness has been fatal in about 60 percent of the cases. The CDC states that the virus is endemic in poultry in six countries, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam.
A WHO report from Indonesia in 2006 illustrates several of the ways that humans become exposed to bird flu viruses. As is common in many cultures, the initial case kept chickens and allowed them into the house at night. The patient also gathered the chicken feces for use as a fertilizer. In other cases, patients also killed and prepared sick poultry for meals, rather than lose the use of a valuable food source.
Proper sanitation and hygienic practices would normally prevent poultry handlers and cooks from contact with sick birds. The greatest numbers of H5N1 cases have been in Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt, where poverty, illiteracy and poor healthcare are factors in human illnesses with avian influenza. Human-to-human spread of the disease has occurred in crowded homes, and in cultures where large groups of relatives sit with the dying for hours at a time.
The CDC is joined by many national and international public health professionals in having concerns about the future of the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.
... the concern is that this H7N9 virus might either adapt to allow efficient transmission during the infection of mammals or reassort its gene segments with human influenza viruses during the co-infection of a single host, resulting in a new virus that would be transmissible from person to person. Such events are believed to have preceded the influenza pandemics of 1918, 1957, and 1968.

Since the avian flu virus was confirmed in wild crows, culling could not be undertaken. All poultry farms and units in the area have been put on surveillance to track further activity of the virus. Confirming the news, Sultanpur district magistrate Aditi Singh said, ""Three days ago, two wild crows were found dead in Haliapur area. Their samples were sent for testing to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal which confirmed the virus."" On what action has been initiated to curb the crisis, Singh said, ""Since the virus was found in wild crows, culling cannot be undertaken immediately. However, the area where they were found dead has been declared as core region of bird flu. Accordingly, 10 teams have been formed to scan all poultry farms in 1km radius of the spot to keep an eye on any outbreak."" She also informed that surveillance activity will also take place in 20 kilometer radius area from the spot on Monday. Highly pathogenic avian flu outbreak was confirmed in Shukla Bazar area of Amethi on March 13, a week after over 350 birds died mysteriously in two villages of the area. State government declared an avian flu alert across the state. Culling of over 850 birds including ducks, hens and pigeons followed thereafter.

The report came the day after officials announced that the virus had hit a turkey farm in Lac Qui Parle County in western Minnesota.The first H5N2 outbreak in the state was reported Mar 5 in Pope County, which adjoins Stearns County on the west. That was followed shortly by two turkey-farm H5N2 outbreaks in Missouri and one in Arkansas. The virus also hit a backyard poultry flock in Kansas recently.One of four barns hitAt the Stearns County farm, the virus struck one of four barns, killing many of the birds in it, Minnesota State Veterinarian Bill Hartmann, DVM, told the Associated Press (AP). Under standard procedures, the USDA said, the farm has been quarantined and all the surviving turkeys will be destroyed to prevent further spread of the virus.Hartmann said there was no known link between Minnesota's latest outbreak and the previous two, according to the AP.Samples from the turkeys were tested after increased deaths were noticed in the flock, the USDA reported. The USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, confirmed initial findings by the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.Stearns County is the second-leading turkey producer in Minnesota, which is the national leader in turkey production, the AP story said. It said more than 40 countries have barred poultry products from Minnesota since the first H5N2 outbreak surfaced.There are several commercial poultry farms and backyard flocks within a quarantine zone established around the outbreak, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health (MBAH) said yesterday. Officials are contacting producers and bird owners to notify them of the quarantine and collect samples for testing.Regarding the Lac Qui Parle County outbreak, the MBAH said 13 backyard poultry flocks were identified in the control zone around the affected farm, and they have been quarantined. Twelve of the flocks tested negative, and results were still awaited on one flock, the board said yesterday.Steve Olson, executive director of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association, said a federal program will compensate the affected turkey farmers for their lost birds and the cost of cleaning and disinfecting the farms, but they won't make money, the St. Cloud (Minn.) Times reported on Mar 28.Dead pelicans in RomaniaIn Romania, 64 wild Dalmatian pelicans in a flock of about 250 were killed by the H5N1 virus, according to a report that Romanian officials filed with World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) today.The birds were on an island in Sinoe Lake on the border of Constanta and Tulcea counties, which lie in southeastern Romania on the Black Sea, according to the report. The dead birds were first noticed on Mar 25.The incident is the first report of H5N1 in Romania since April 2010, officials said. Romania is bordered on the south by Bulgaria, which reported the death of 21 pelicans from H5N1 last week. The deaths were in the northeastern province of Silistra, which adjoins Romania.Elsewhere, a low-pathogenic H7 virus was found in a flock of 22,273 layer chickens in the Netherlands, Dutch officials told the OIE on Mar 27. The outbreak was in Friesland province. The virus didn't kill any of the birds, but the whole flock was destroyed as a precaution against spread, the report said.See also: Mar 28 USDA press releaseMar 28 AP storyMBAH information on H5N2 outbreaksRelated Mar 27 CIDRAP News itemMar 28 St. Cloud Times storyMar 30 OIE report on H5N1 in RomaniaMar 27 OIE report on H7 in the Netherlands;2015-03-30;126;;;
152;99;152;Bird Flu Confirmed in Arkansas as Mexico Expands Poultry Ban;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/bird-flu-confirmed-in-arkansas-as-mexico-expands-poultry-limits;" The U.S. government confirmed a case of bird flu in Arkansas as the disease spreads into the southeast of the country, the heart of the domestic poultry industry.
The H5N2 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza was confirmed in a commercial turkey flock in Boone County, Arkansas, a unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a statement Wednesday.
The disease has spread this month after appearing in a migratory route along the Mississippi River. Previously, the outbreak that started in mid-December was contained in western states. Butterball LLC, the largest U.S. turkey, said Wednesday that the virus has affected farms that supply the company. Cargill Inc. said that Missouri’s agriculture agency indicated preliminary positive tests in two flocks, including a company contract site.
China has halted all U.S. poultry imports since January. Mexico, the top importer of U.S. chicken and turkey, expanded bans this week to restrict shipments from other states with cases in commercial flocks: California, Missouri and Minnesota, the top turkey producer. The European Union, Guatemala, Jordan and more than a dozen other countries have also restricted some U.S. shipments.
“It seems to be spreading fast,” Ron Plain, a livestock economist at the University of Missouri in Columbia, said in a telephone interview. “A lot of our foreign customers will stop purchases from impacted states.”
Butterball FarmsThe Arkansas and Jasper County, Missouri, turkey operations affected by the virus are contract farms that supply to Garner, North Carolina-based Butterball, Stephanie Llorente, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. Cargill said in an e-mail that Missouri’s preliminary positive results for the H5N2 virus included a company contract farm close to Fortuna, Missouri.
“Our first concern is always the health and safety of the people who enjoy our products, as well as the care and well-being of our turkeys,” Llorente said.
Springdale, Arkansas, is the home of Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. chicken producer. The company’s shares fell the most since June after Reuters earlier reported the suspected case in the state. No flocks grown for the company have been diagnosed with avian influenza, spokesman Worth Sparkman said in an e-mail.
Pilgrim’s PrideShares of Pilgrim’s Pride Corp., the second-biggest U.S. chicken producer, tumbled as much as 9 percent.
Closely held Butterball is the top turkey producer. Pilgrim’s Pride is based in Greeley, Colorado.
Cargill, one of the world’s biggest agriculture companies, said flu tests at almost 80 farms within a 12-mile (19-kilometer) radius of the operation cited by the state of Missouri state were negative.
Closely held Cargill, based in Minneapolis, said no company flock in Arkansas tested positive.
“This is a big problem, especially for our turkey industry,” James Sumner, the president of the Stone Mountain, Georgia-based USA Poultry &amp; Egg Export Council, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. “We were in Mexico this week meeting with government officials and trying to prevail upon them to treat this as we treat it.”
This outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza is the first in U.S. commercial poultry since 2004. The disease is highly contagious among birds. None of the viruses have been identified in humans, and are not expected to pose a public health risk, USDA’s Animal &amp; Plant Health Inspection Service said in a statement on its website on March 10.
‘Heightened Measures’“We’re encouraging everybody in the industry to take heightened biosecurity measures,” Sumner said. “At the same time, we recognize that if it’s in the flyways and in the migratory birds, it’s going to show up in these other states. It’s just a matter of time. We’re telling everybody to take extreme care in trying to prevent any contamination.”
The flu hasn’t been detected on any commercial broiler farm in the Mississippi flyway, Tom Super, a spokesman for the National Chicken Council, said in an e-mail.

	YAMAGUCHI – An outbreak of highly pathogenic bird influenza has been confirmed in Yamaguchi Prefecture, officials said Tuesday.
Prefectural officials started work to slaughter some 37,000 chickens at a farm in Nagato, about 275 km north of the city of Miyazaki, where another outbreak has occurred.
The Yamaguchi Prefectural Government banned chickens and other domestic poultry, whether dead or alive, within a 3-km radius of the Nagato farm from being moved out of the area and dead poultry within 10 km from being shipped outside.
The outbreak followed two recently confirmed cases of highly pathogenic bird flu in Miyazaki Prefecture.
According to the Yamaguchi government, 21 chickens died at the Nagato farm on Sunday and Monday.
The dead chickens tested positive for influenza in basic tests conducted Monday. The prefectural government announced early Tuesday that a genetic test confirmed the virus was present.
In Miyazaki, the prefectural government announced the detection of the virus on a farm in the city of Miyazaki late Sunday night and culled all 42,000 birds there, officials said Monday.
The first case was confirmed Dec. 16 in the city of Nobeoka, also in Miyazaki Prefecture, which is known as the country’s top producer of broiler chickens.
All three cases involve the H5 variety of the virus, according to officials.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Tuesday the central government will ramp up measures against bird flu.
“We will continue to take all necessary measures if any further outbreaks are confirmed,” he said at a gathering of ministers in charge of affairs related to the government’s response to bird flu outbreaks.
The ministers confirmed close cooperation and agreed to enhance information collection and disease control measures.
At a news conference afterward, agriculture minister Koya Nishikawa said, “I am very concerned that the outbreaks occurred earlier than usual.”
He noted that bird flu cases usually peak between January and mid-February in Japan.
The outbreaks are unlikely to affect widespread distribution of chicken or eggs in the country anytime soon, but all possible measures should be taken, he said, requesting poultry farmers to be on their guard.
In the case in the city of Miyazaki, the farm reported to the prefecture at about 11:30 a.m. Sunday that increasing numbers of chickens were dying. Chickens later tested positive in a genetic test for bird flu.
The Miyazaki government has asked five other chicken farms located within 3 km of the affected farm to refrain from shipping any of their approximately 145,000 chickens.
It also asked farms within 10 km not to take any dead chickens out of the 10-km radius zone. A total of 55 chicken farms are located within the 10-km radius, excluding the five in the 3-km zone.
The prefectural government called on poultry farmers during an emergency meeting Monday morning to take thorough disease control measures, but one of the participants said the situation is distressing because the poultry farm in question “got infected even though it was taking proper protective measures.”
Yamaguchi Prefecture is following similar procedures, culling around 37,000 birds and placing bans on the movement and shipment of chickens in the area.
In January 2004, the prefecture reported chickens at a farm in what is now the city of Yamaguchi were infected with a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu, the first avian flu case in Japan in nearly 80 years. In that outbreak, about 34,000 birds were culled.

THE DEPARTMENT of Agriculture (DA) has lifted the ban on poultry products coming from Japan, nearly a year after the agency temporarily stopped admitting shipments from that country. 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	In an order released over the weekend, DA Secretary Proceso J. Alcala announced that “the risk of contamination from importing poultry and poultry products from Japan is negligible.”This follows an evaluation by the Bureau of Animal Industry, which cited the resolution of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) event as reported by Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture.The lifting of the ban covers domestic and wild birds -- including poultry meat, day-old chicks, eggs and semen originating from Japan.In April 2014, the DA banned the entry of the poultry products following the outbreak of HPAI virus in parts of Japan.The outbreak was detected in a poultry broiler farm and was confirmed by the central laboratory.Other import bans on poultry products are still in effect in the Philippines, covering the states of Oregon, Idaho and Washington in the United States, Chiayi County in Taiwan and Israel.Reports of infestations affecting poultry products are communicated to the Office of International des Epizooties (OIE), an inter-governmental organization.The OIE is in charge of informing governments of the occurrence of animal diseases and of ways to control these diseases.It also coordinates studies on the surveillance and control of animal diseases and of harmonizing regulations to facilitate trade in animals and animal products. -- Claire-Ann Marie C.

JAPAN - The H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus has been detected in samples from wild ducks on Honshu.The Japanese veterinary authority sent Follow Up Report No.1 dated 21 November to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). 
The report confirms the presence of the H5N8 highly pathogenic bird flu virus in faecal samples from an unidentified wild duck on 18 November at Chosei-gun in Chiba prefecture, which is not far from Tokyo in the south-east of Honshu island. 
It was confirmed on 20 November 2014 that two out of 50 faecal samples from Anatidae (wild birds, species unknown) were positive for H5N8 influenza A virus. The samples had been collected on 18 November 2014 and were subject to virus isolation and RT-PCR. The confirmation tests on the pathogenicity of the virus are conducted by the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH)

169;33;169;Japan farms on high alert for bird flu outbreak;http://news.asiaone.com/news/asia/japan-farms-high-alert-bird-flu-outbreak;"The nation's poultry farms and relevant ministries are on high alert over bird flu, with farmers busy inspecting and disinfecting chicken coops.
 
 
 
The tension is due to a series of cases in which highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been detected in migratory birds.No such viruses were detected in the three previous seasons, but four cases have already been reported since November this year. A season is defined as October to May of the following year.In some Asian nations that serve as stopovers for migratory birds, the viruses have been spreading throughout poultry plants and other facilities.The H5 and H7 strains are among the highly toxic varieties of bird flu. Although it does not usually infect people, some rare cases of human infection have been reported in China and other countries.Poultry farms nervous""There's nothing we can do to stop migratory birds from coming,"" said a 35-year-old female employee of a poultry farm in Saitama Prefecture. ""I'm concerned that birds carrying the virus could enter the poultry housing.""The farm's chicken facilities, which are home to about 7,000 birds, are covered with netting to prevent the intrusion of wild birds. These nets are checked often and mended immediately if any tears are discovered. Access to the housing is restricted to staff only, and workers' boots are sanitized regularly to prevent the transmission of viruses.A farming centre of the Tokyo Development Foundation for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, in Ome, Tokyo, raises an original breed of silky fowl known as Tokyo Ukokkei and sells chicks to poultry farmers.The centre has been keeping anyone who is not a staff member away from the chicken coop, and employees must put on special work clothes before entering the facility.""If an outbreak were to occur at the centre, the Tokyo Ukokkei would be extinguished,"" said one worker.2011 pandemic revisitedThis season's first highly pathogenic flu virus in a migrating bird was found in Yasugi, Shimane Prefecture, on Nov. 13. It was followed by additional cases in the town of Nagara in Chiba Prefecture and Tottori. In the first case, the H5N8 subtype was detected in the droppings of migratory Bewick's swans. On Nov. 29, the virus was found in a debilitated white-naped crane in Izumi, Kagoshima Prefecture, the nation's largest wintering spot for cranes.The previous time that a highly pathogenic virus was detected in migratory birds in the nation was in May 2011. During that season, the number of confirmed infections reached 60. As the infections spread to poultry farms, about 1.85 million birds had to be slaughtered in nine prefectures, including Miyazaki, Aichi and Chiba.In April this year, bird flu was confirmed at a poultry house in Kumamoto Prefecture, though the case's relation to migratory birds is not clear. About 110,000 specimens were culled.""Avian flu viruses have been confirmed one after another since late autumn, and the situation looks similar to the pandemic four years ago,"" said an Environment Ministry official.Outbreak in AsiaThere is also growing concern about bird flu due to the spread of infections in Asian nations that serve as stopover spots or breeding sites for migratory birds that fly to and from Japan.South Korea has experienced continuous epidemics over the past year since last season, according to the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry. The number of domestic chickens infected with flu viruses reached a record high of 245 after January, and at least 14 million birds were slaughtered. In China, about 50 cases of highly pathogenic flu viruses have been detected since September.In response, the Environment Ministry has tightened monitoring by raising the nationwide bird flu alert level from 2 to 3, the highest level, and increasing the frequency of virus tests. The agriculture ministry issued a statement to prefectures across the nation requesting thorough measures to prevent infection, stating that any poultry farm can fall victim to an outbreak of bird flu, and emphasizing the heightened alert.";2014-12-06;0;;;
174;130;174;Bird Flu Returns to India;http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/34845/bird-flu-returns-to-india;"Poultry News Bird Flu Returns to India15 April 2015 INDIA - An outbreak of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed in the state of Telangana, which is in the south of the country.Scrambling to contain the spread of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus, the Telangana government on 14 April ordered the immediate culling of 145,000 chickens on poultry farms located in a one-kilometre radius of the infected farm in Thorrur village of Hayathnagar mandal in Ranga Reddy district. 
This is the first ever outbreak of the disease reported in the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, according to Times of India on 15 April. 
Simultaneously, a ban on trading of all poultry products from farms in a 10-kilometre radius 'surveillance zone' was put in place. 
The outbreak of the disease had an immediate impact with the Telangana Poultry Breeders Association staring at a loss of over 300 million rupees (INR), especially after Andhra Pradesh banned entry of all poultry products into its territory. 
Authorities in Hyderabad said the outbreak came to light after several birds started mysteriously dying in Srinivasa Reddy Poultry Farm owned by V. Balakrishna Reddy in Thorrur village from 8 April, prompting them to send bird samples to a testing laboratory in Bhopal. 
""The tests confirmed that it was the H5N1 virus and we advised the animal husbandry department in Telangana and the Centre to take all appropriate measures,"" D.D. Kulkarni, joint director, High-Security Animal Disease Laboratory, told Times of India from Bhopal. 
Within hours, dozens of animal husbandry workers wearing protective gear, began the culling operation in the infected farm and put the birds and eggs in huge gunny sacks and buried them in deep pits. 
Dr D. Venkateswarulu, director of animal husbandry department, told reporters in the afternoon that the culling operation in farms located in one-kilometre radius would be completed in the next 48 hours. This will be followed by sanitisation and disinfection operations. 
A Central Rapid Response team comprising Dr S.K. Jain and Dr Pranay verma, both avian influenza specialists, is arriving in Hyderabad to oversee the culling. 
Meanwhile, the department staff have begun collecting serum and dropping samples of the birds from farms in the 10-km radius to be tested for the virus. If any of the tests come positive, then the government will widen the culling operations. Containment in the surveillance zone will be in place for a week or 10 days until all tests are completed. 
Dr Venkateswarulu said they were collecting information on egg sales over the past 20 days from Balakrishna Reddy's farm, to find out where they were transported. If it is found that the stock is yet to be sold, they will order destruction of such eggs. If the eggs were sold to other states, then the department will immediately notify the states and provide them information so that the eggs can be destroyed. 
The official said that chicken or eggs procured from farms outside of the surveillance zone can be consumed and there was no cause for panic. If the chicken is well cooked or the egg boiled, then there is no danger of contracting the virus by humans. If these are cooked at 70°C and above for 20 minutes, the virus will die, Dr Venkateswarulu said. 
While weather does play a role in the spread of flu, Dr Venkateswarulu said that the most accepted theory is that the disease is spread by migratory birds which is contracted either by the chicken directly or through an intermediary carrier bird species. 
In 2006, the government in Andhra Pradesh carried out some preventive culling but the enormity of the task this time around has everyone anxious. In Hayathnagar, authorities supplied 2,500 tamiflu tablets to health workers. Health department officials also began a massive house-to-house surveillance with 300 Asha, ANMs and multi-purpose health workers, said Dr G Srinivas Rao, joint director, Epidemic Cell, Telangana. 
""We are not leaving anything to chance and will take up all efforts to stop the virus from spreading. The swine flu isolation wards will be used in case there is any need,"" he told Times of India. 
Since 2003, there have been 400 human deaths globally from the H5N1 strain and hundreds of confirmed cases of infection. In India, the virus was first detected in Jalgaon, Maharashtra, in 2006 and ever since reports of fresh outbreaks have been sporadically reported from all corners of the country. The last outbreak occurred in Kerala in January 2015.

Download “Letter to Secretary of State Dijksma on the outbreak of bird flu in Hekendorp”
 Mr President-In-Office,On a poultry farm in hekendorp (municipality of Oudewater) is on 15 november JL. an outbreak of bird flu (Avian Influenza, AI) of the H5 variant  established. It concerns high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is of type H5N8. HPAI is  bestrijdingsplichtig in the European legislation.
With this letter I message you about this infection and the measures I have affected.
Monitoring and early warning
In Netherlands are on commercial poultry farms regularly samples taken, which are tested for bird flu (regular monitoring). In Addition There is a system in which veterinarians in certain disease symptoms, that may indicate bird flu, submit samples for research (early warning). For bird flu is a hailing at a suspicion.
Last Friday, 14 november. a poultry farm in hekendorp (municipality of Oudewater) samples submitted because the chicken disease symptoms had that possibly being on bird flu. Yesterday it became clear that it is the H5 variant of avian flu concerned and this morning was after laboratory testing clear that the avian flu virus is the highly pathogenic variant on this company.
Now is also clear that the virus is the type H5N8. This is the same type as has been established in Germany at the beginning of november.
Measures
The RIVM indicates that in rare cases some virus types passing poultry on people. This only happens if there is direct and intensive contact with infected poultry. People who get sick from bird flu get the same symptoms as a normal winter flu, generally expires bird flu in humans mild. To prevent people involved in the culling are protective measures become infected.
It is a legpluimveebedrijf with six stables with a total of around 150,000 laying hens. This company has no outdoor access. Today, Sunday november 16th, is with the culling of the company started. The chickens will be on the company  killed and be drained to destruction. The cull is carried out by the Dutch food and consumer product safety authority (VWA).
The highly pathogenic variant of bird flu is highly contagious for poultry.
This variant is deadly for chickens. Bird flu is a zoonosis, which means that the infection can be transferred from animals to humans.
Because of the high risk of infection is from Sunday 16 november 2014, 11.30 hours a total transport ban (standstill) for poultry and other poultry, eggs, poultry manure and litter from poultry companies set.
This is true for mixed farms with a transport ban pluimveehouderijtak also for other animals and manure of other animals.
In addition to the transport ban is also a guard duty and for poultry and ophok other fowl throughout Netherlands set and applies a visitors scheme on all poultry farms and mixed farms with poultry. Also is there for very Netherlands set up a hunting ban on all animals. Finally, a collect ban poultry and other fowl and exhibition prohibition of force. The obligations also apply to hobby poultry and animal holders other poultry.
European legislation requires that there is a 3 and 10 km area is set (protection and surveillance zone). Currently in force in this area the same measures as in the rest of Netherlands.  In the 10 km area are 16 other poultry farms. These companies be sampled and tested for bird flu. Also be contacts of the company investigated.
The coming days are focused on the origin and spread of the virus to find out and prevent further spread.
I will of course keep you informed of developments.

 Two samples from wild ducks around the area of Kamerik, Woerden, in the Netherlands, have tested positive for a highly pathogenic H5 strain of avian influenza, Rijksoverheid.nl confirmed in a statement last night (1 December).
 
 The samples were taken as part of the investigation into the possible role of wild birds in the spread of the disease in the country.It follows the discovery of a fourth case of avian influenza in the Netherlands last weekend, which was confirmed as the H5N8 strain – the same as the cases discovered earlier this month.The latest outbreak in Zoeterwoude saw all susceptible birds – around 50,000 – culled on 30 November.In a letter to parliament, minister for agriculture Sharon Dijksma said that analysis by the Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) of the bird flu outbreaks in Hekendorp, Ter Aar and Kamperveen occurred independently.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been found in at least 60 commercial poultry flocks, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. The majority are turkeys, and Minnesota, the nation’s top producer, has been hit hardest with an estimated 2.6 million causalities. On Thursday, Governor Mark Dayton declared a state of emergency, ordering support for animal health and agriculture agencies.
At stake is the roughly $4.8 billion made from the more than 200 million turkeys produced in the U.S., the latest government figures show. Flocks with more than 3 million of the birds have been affected by the disease in this outbreak, the worst in three decades. Countries from Europe to Asia have placed restrictions on American poultry shipments.
“If everything works right” getting a poultry barn running again will take eight to nine weeks, Steve Olson, the executive director of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association in Buffalo, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. “This is completely new. We’ve had occasional cases in the U.S., but not this many.”
‘Star Gazing’Turkeys showing flu symptoms stop eating and drinking, turn lethargic and begin “star gazing,” or twisting their necks, John Clifford, the USDA’s chief veterinarian, said Wednesday on a conference call. Those signs can be followed “pretty rapidly” by death, he said.
Sick or dead birds are analyzed to confirm the disease, said Lori Miller, a senior staff officer and environmental engineer at USDA’s Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service. She is part of the response team to the virus in Minnesota.
Hormel Foods Corp., the owner of Jennie-O turkeys, said Monday that annual profit may be eroded because bird flu is hampering production.
Corn for July delivery fell for a fifth day in Chicago, the longest run in 11 weeks. Prices slid 0.5 percent to $3.7475 a bushel on concern the outbreak will hurt feed demand.
This flu is “extremely infectious and fatal,” according to the USDA. Once the virus is confirmed as positive in a flock, any birds remaining are euthanized in a humane manner, Miller said Tuesday in a telephone interview.
Asphyxiation ProcessThe American Veterinary Medical Association supports the use of water-based foam as a method for flock “depopulation.”
“There’s a crew that comes in, and they use that foamer to euthanize the birds,” Olson of the turkey association said. “It’s basically an asphyxiation process” and causes “no stress to the bird,” he said.
Foaming crews are contracted by the USDA, said Clifford, the department’s chief veterinarian.
In Minnesota, infected birds killed are typically composted in the barn, Olson of the turkey association said. That process takes a few weeks, Miller of the USDA unit said. A federal appraiser visits farms before any depopulation occurs to provide owners some compensation for living birds, Olson said.
A cleanup team will remove and dispose of wood chips, bedding and other material from barns, using anything from hand shovels to front-end loaders, Miller said. The facility is swept out, and cleaning begins with workers using backpack sprayers and power washers to hose down barns with soap and water, she said.
Most Important“The soap part is very important because that inactivates the virus,” Miller said. “Just cleaning alone will get you pretty far in terms of getting rid of the virus. That’s probably the most important step.”
Premises are rinsed and allowed to dry before crews spray a disinfectant on every surface. After being sprayed and dried again, personnel take samples from surfaces for testing to make sure the virus is gone, Miller said. Barns have to sit empty for three weeks after cleaning and disinfection is complete, according to an e-mail from Joelle Hayden, a spokeswoman for the USDA’s Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service.
If the samples test negative for the virus, a “regulatory process” takes place to clear the facility and allow producers to restock barns with poultry, Miller of the USDA unit said.
Regular warm weather is needed to help quell the spread of the virus, Clifford said Tuesday on a media conference call with the Iowa Department of Agriculture.
On Thursday, Wisconsin, Minnesota’s eastern neighbor, reported its sixth bird flu case involving a flock of 90,000 turkeys in Barron County, the second discovery there. Iowa, to the south, reported its third case, affecting 34,000 turkeys in Sac County.
Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker on Monday authorized the state’s National Guard to help agriculture authorities respond to the flu in three counties.
China has banned U.S. poultry imports, and Japan, South Korea and Taiwan restricted shipments. Birds from infected flocks don’t enter the food system, according to the USDA.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — One new Minnesota turkey farm has been hit by bird flu, raising the state’s total to 85 since the outbreaks were first confirmed in early March.
The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the latest case is in Swift County. The flock size hasn’t been reported yet, but Minnesota turkey and chicken producers have now lost nearly 5.7 million turkeys and chickens to the disease.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture now reports over 140 findings of highly pathogenic avian influenza across the country, which have affected more than 30 million chickens and turkeys.
Minnesota, the country’s top turkey producing state, has had the most farms hit by the H5N2 virus, but Iowa, the country’s top egg producer, has lost by far the most birds at more than 24 million.

219;513;219;Azerbaijan bans poultry meat import from Iran;http://www.azernews.az/business/84274.html;" 
By Amina Nazarli
Azerbaijan has suspended the import of poultry meat and products from Iran since June 22.
Yolchu Khanveli, the representative of the State Veterinary Service at the Azerbaijan Agriculture Ministry, said Azerbaijan banned import of poultry and eggs from the Iranian province of Mazandaran, citing immediate public health concerns.
Earlier on June 19, a case of avian influenza virus had been reported in a flock of 25 birds in Amol village in the province of Mazandaran, according to the National Wildlife Health Center.
Seven birds from the flock died and the rest were culled to prevent the further spread of the virus.
The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus is highly contagious among birds, and can be deadly, especially for domestic poultry. Since December 2003, the Asian HPAI H5N1 virus resulted in devastatingly high rate of mortality for poultry and wild birds in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa.
In order to prevent the spread of these viruses in the country, Azerbaijan temporarily halted the import of poultry into the country, Khanveli noted.
The situation has been under control as of June 22, and there have been no recorded cases of the virus thus far. To maintain stability, the government takes all the necessary measures, Khanveli stressed.
The poultry industry developed in Azerbaijan in the late 90's, thanks to the privatization and modernization of Soviet era factory farms. The industry now uses modern automation technology in new, more technologically advanced facilities.
Experts say that today, poultry is the most lucrative sector in Azerbaijan’s domestic livestock, which helps to offset the amount of poultry imported into the country.
“The state program on providing the Azerbaijani population of food products for 2008-2015” aimed to increase the production of poultry meat in the country to 90,000 tons from 61,000 in 2007 and egg production to 1.3 billion pieces from 953 million in 2007.
Since 2011, the demand for eggs was covered mainly by imports, due to a lack of breeding farms. Only 45 percent of domestic demand was covered by the country.
After establishing a large poultry farm in Zira village in 2011, equipped with modern facilities made in Holland, Italy, and Turkey, the costs of producing eggs were significantly reduced.

236;220;236;Bird Flu May Affect Turkey Market Come Thanksgiving;http://www.thedailymeal.com/eat/bird-flu-may-affect-turkey-market-come-thanksgiving;"Following the worst-ever U.S. outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, supplies of whole turkeys may be limited when Thanksgiving rolls around.
Roughly 7.8 million turkeys died this year as a result of the outbreak, according to Reuters. There has also been a drop in poults (young turkey or fowl being raised for food), whose numbers are down eight percent compared to last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Poults who are developed in May head to slaughter between August to October, depending on whether the birds are male or female. Amanda Martin, senior analyst with Indiana-based Express Markets Inc. Analytics, said to Reuters there is a May and June deadline to place heavy tom poults to develop so they can be ready to be sold as whole birds come November.
“To see that it is down … makes me think, that's probably going to mean the big, whole birds for Thanksgiving are going to be extremely hard to come by,"" Martin told Reuters.
Experts don’t all agree that this outbreak will affect turkey sales, as some credit the drop in placement numbers to “bunching effects” in the production of turkeys. National Turkey Federation spokesman Keith Williams also told Reuters that most people buy frozen turkeys, and said that those consumed this upcoming November were slaughtered before the bird flu struck the upper Midwest. 
 
 
Still, bird flu has already made an impact on the market. U.S companies are importing eggs from Europe for the first time in over a decade to combat rising prices of domestic eggs due to the virus. States have even declared a state of emergency due to bird flu, so seeing the virus affect turkey prices come Thanksgiving isn’t difficult to imagine.

PARIS India has found two outbreaks of a highly contagious bird flu virus in the southern state of Kerala, prompting the authorities to cull more than 200,000 birds, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Tuesday.The virus itself killed about 15,000 infected ducks in Kottayam and another 500 in nearby Alappuzha, the first cases of the disease in the country since February this year, the Paris-based OIE reported on its website, citing data submitted by the Indian ministry of agriculture. The report said the animals died of an H5 strain of the flu virus but did not specify the exact variant.Germany, the Netherlands and Britain have been hit this month by the H5N8 bird flu strain which has devastated flocks in Asia, mainly South Korea, earlier this year but has never been detected in humans. 
 
 Another strain, the feared H5N1, can be fatal to humans. It caused the deaths of nearly 400 people and hundreds of millions of poultry after it spread from Asia into Europe and Africa in 2005-2006.""This is not a rare event,"" OIE Director General Bernard Vallat told Reuters. ""India regularly reports cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild and domestic birds.""
 
 ""The problem in this case is that they have not been able to determine which variant yet, whether it is the same as the one in Korea and elsewhere.""Over 200,000 birds were being culled in the villages where the outbreaks were found and an intensive surveillance campaign had been launched in a 10 km radius around the area to ensure that the virus did not spread further, the Indian ministry said it its report.
 
 Since 2006 India has culled 6.4 million birds due to bird flu, Vallat said, adding that the latest outbreaks were not a particular cause for concern. (Reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide; Editing by Keith Weir)";2014-11-25;56;;;

	""There is a particular high risk of of the virus spreading to Novosibirsk, Tomsk, Omsk, Kurgan Oblasts, the Altai Territory and the northern part of Yakutia,"" according to Rosselhoznadzor.At the end of April, a gene of highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in curly pelicans, in the Ikryaninsky district of the Astrakhan Oblast. It is said that large numbers of wild birds may be infected with the highly virulent strain of AI and it is almost impossible to fully eliminate the possibility of them coming into contact with poultry on farms.At the same time, according to the Russian veterinary experts, the situation can become more complicated if the virus would spread to the European part of Russia, where the largest poultry farms are located. A spreading of the virus to poultry farms in Siberia, with its small population, would be far less dangerous to humans than an outbreak in the central part of Russia.

How many? Where are they?In anticipation of a possible outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, those are the questions the state Department of Environmental Management are asking chicken owners in Rhode Island.The disease has not been found in Rhode Island but “DEM is taking steps now to control HPAI should it spread to
the Ocean State,” according to a Wednesday news release. “As part of these preparations the Department is reaching
out to all poultry owners, including commercial as well as backyard or hobby
breeders, and asking them to voluntarily notify DEM of the location of their
poultry and the approximate number and type of birds they possess.”The state has developed a HPAI response plan which lays out the steps that would be taken to protect public and animal health if the disease is detected.“The sooner DEM can
identify the location of poultry within a control zone, the sooner the
surveillance testing can take place and the sooner the control zone can be
released if all testing is found to be negative. That is why the information
from poultry owners about the location and number of birds they have is so
important,” the DEM said.From the DEM:Poultry owners are asked to download a form from the DEM
website that will capture all of the necessary information. The form is
available at http://www.dem.ri.gov/programs/bnatres/agricult/pdf/hpai_readiness.pdf

now to protect their poultry. These biosecurity precautions can be viewed at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/downloads/animal_diseases/ai/HPAIchecklist.pdf
(more appropriate for commercial operations) and http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov/
(which is general information tailored more to hobbyists and non-commercial
poultry owners). The US Department of Agriculture considers HPAI to be among
the worst animal disease outbreaks in American history. Currently, HPAI has
been found in 21 Western and Midwestern states. As of August 5, 2015, there
have been 232 affected premises in those states. Nearly 50 million chickens and
turkeys have died as a result of infection or control measures to stop the
spread of this disease. Thankfully this strain of HPAI has not been reported to
affect people, but public health officials continue to pay close attention to
note any changes in that pattern and continue to prohibit the introduction of
infected poultry products into the food chain.

The Iowa Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Tuesday that a turkey farm that was infected with the bird flu completed the cleaning and disinfection process and is starting over.
Iowa Turkey Federation spokesperson, Gretta Irwin, says they are pleased to see the progress. “It’s definitely good news that the turkey farms that have been impacted with the high path avian influenza are starting to restock now in Iowa,” Irwin says.
The turkey farms composted the dead birds in their buildings and then those buildings had be cleaned and tested before new birds could be brought in. “Our first farm is the Moline farm up in Manson. And they placed birds this last week and are getting back into production,” Irwin says.
The farm in Calhoun County was confirmed to have the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza on May 19th. This farm had six barns that hold 28,800 turkey poults that ranged from birth to five weeks of age, and 14,400 finisher turkeys that are five  to 20 weeks of age.
New birds were place in the buildings last Friday (July 31st) Irwin says they it won’t belong before more turkey farms follow. “Other farms are currently in the stage of testing,” Irwin explains, “so they have to have tests in their barns to prove that there is no virus in those barns to prove that they can repopulate. So there’ll be other farms coming quite soon.”
There were some 34 million turkeys and chickens destroyed after they became infected. Irwin says “This has been very hard on the turkey farmers who have lost their birds to high path A-I. And seeing other farms becoming repopulated is very encouraging to all of those farmers,” Irwin says. “This tragedy is about ready to end and they can get back to what they do best — which is raising and caring for turkeys.”
The Iowa Department of Agriculture says it is in the process of lifting 69 of the 77 control zones that were established around facilities in Iowa infected with the avian flu.
The control zones were established around each site with a confirmed case of the disease and all poultry that were located within the control zone surrounding an infected site were quarantined and all movement of poultry and poultry products, feed, fuel in and out of those quarantined non-infected facilities had to be permitted by the Ag Department.

 High-pathogenic bird flu hits Germany – again
 
 Wednesday 29 July 2015 12:51 
 
 © Action Press/Rex ShutterstockA fresh outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza has been reported in Germany this week, involving a flock of 10,100 layers in the north-west of the country.
German chief vet Karin Schwabenbauer informed the World Organisation for Animal Health in Paris on Monday (27 July) that 50 birds in the flock had died and the remaining birds on the farm in the Emsland district of Lower Saxony had been destroyed.
Laboratory analysis had confirmed the strain as highly pathogenic H7N7 – the same sub-type that affected the UK earlier this month.

According to EU law, the German state authorities have set up a 3km protection zone and a 10km surveillance zone around the holding, applying strict movement restrictions on farms in the area.
It is reported that preliminary cleaning and disinfection is now under way. Three backyard flocks on neighbouring farms have also been culled as a precaution.
The chief vet’s statement also makes clear that no poultrymeat or eggs have been dispatched from the affected area to other parts of Germany or other EU countries.
Highly pathogenic avian influenza was last seen in Lower Saxony in December 2014 on a turkey farm. Then the strain was H5N8 – the same strain as was found on an east Yorkshire duck farm last November.
This was followed by further outbreaks of H5N8 elsewhere in Germany in early 2015, as well as more recent outbreaks of low-pathogenic H7N7.

	About 79,134 birds worth over N85 million were lost to Avian Influenza, popularly known as bird flu in Lagos, the Director, Veterinary Services, State Agricultural Development Authority, Dr Ganiu Adams, has said.
To control the spread of the disease, he said the veterinary department depopulated 71,026 birds.
He said 20 farms in Lagos have been confirmed positive for bird flu infection following laboratory examination by the National Veterinary Research Institute in Vom, Plateau State.
In a statement in Abuja, Adams said bird flu education remained a critical and central strategy of control of the disease worldwide.
He said many poultry trades risked being affected by the highly pathogenic Avian Influenza, adding that few commercial farms and live birds markets practice adequate bio-security measures.
“Since the beginning of July, streams of reports of high mortalities of birds in various poultry farms across Lagos State have been pouring into the Avian Influenza desk office. So far, 20 farms in Lagos have been confirmed positive for bird flu infection following laboratory examination carried out by the National Veterinary Research Institute.
“The current scourge has led to the loss of 79,134 birds with an estimated worth of over N85 million. This excludes the stock of farmers who did not make official report to the state. To control the spread of the disease, the veterinary department depopulated 71,026 birds,” he said.
Adams, who spoke at the Sensitisation/Awareness Workshop for Stakeholders on Preventive Measures against Avian Influenza, added that the state was at risk of bird flu infection through birds being brought from other parts of the country. The state, he said, accounts for over 200 poultry markets and serves as the most popular outlet for poultry and poultry products from different parts of the country.
Earlier, the Federal Government called for collaboration with the private sector to prevent further outbreak of the disease.
The Director, Federal Department of Veterinary and Pest Control Services, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural development, Dr. Abdulganiyu Abubakar, said it was sad to note that after about eight weeks of non-report of suspicious outbreak of the flu nationwide, the disease was recently recorded in Lagos and Oyo states. It also made incursions into Abia and Enugu states.
He said the problem must be urgently addressed because of the grave consequences of the outbreaks on the traumatised poultry industry.
Abubakar said: “It is thus imperative that concrete steps are taken to reduce the socio-economic impact of bird flu and improve the well-being of our people. I am aware that participants at this workshop are important stakeholders from the private and public sectors.
“This I believe will foster the much needed spirit of public-private partnership and collaboration in the current fight against the on-going threat of bird flu.”

France has reported its first outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu virus, a highly pathogenic virus. The virus has reportedly killed 22 chickens out of 32 that were kept in a family backyard at Biras in the Perigord region, according to Reuters. 
An unnamed official said they have set up a 6.2 miles radius around the site, which includes several poultry farms.  
Agriculture Minster Stephane Le Foll has insisted there is no risk to the general public. ""This virus has no effect as far as consuming poultry meat or anything that comes from poultry products is concerned - I am thinking particularly about foie gras since we are approaching times of high consumption,"" Le Foll told reporters. 
Officials in Vietnam have also detected the virus in poultry in that country. They said that 100 birds had died in Ha Tinh province in the north-central part of the country, according to World Organization for Animal Health report. 
The H5N1 virus was first detected in humans in 1997 during an outbreak in Hong Kong. It then re-emerged in 2003 and 2004 and has infected million of poultry, several hundred humans and even caused some human deaths. 
The US Government said that human infections usually occur in those who have had contact with sick or dead poultry that have the virus. They also report that 60 percent of people who contract the virus die from it. 
Confirmed cases of H5N1 in humans have nearly tripled since last year when there were 52 reported cases. In 2015 so far there have been 143 cases reported to the World Health Organization. 
This is the first reported case of H5N1 in the European Union since March, following outbreaks in Bulgaria and Romania.

	This is the first case of the highly pathogenous H5N1 strain in France since 2007, according to French media reports
	
 The French authorities have detected a case of severe avian flu on a poultry farm in the Dordogne region of the country.
 
	
 Tests carried out after a high number of deaths among the farm’s birds found that “this is the highly pathogenous H5N1 strain”, the French ministry of agriculture said in a statement on Wednesday.DNA analysis is underway and the ministry has indicated that this strain seems to have evolved from a more benign one previously detected in Europe.Two levels of restrictions and monitoring measures are in place within a 3km and 10km radius around the farm. Although the French authorities say the virus is not transmitted to humans through poultry products, they are investigating whether the strain found in France can be transmitted from live animals to humans.According to French media reports, this is the first such case in the country since 2007. H5N1 bird flu first infected humans in 1997 during a poultry outbreak in Hong Kong.Meanwhile, five new outbreaks of the notifiable disease bluetongue were reported in France last week. The first outbreak in the country was discovered on a farm in the Allier region in central France in mid-September.This was the first case of the virus in the EU since 2011. There has been 78 outbreaks in the country so far this year.The latest five outbreaks have only affected cattle, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health, whereas the first outbreak affected both cattle and sheep. Following the discovery of the first outbreak in September, France vaccinated 1.3m animals against the disease. Agriculture Minister Stéphane Le Foll said that 1.3m doses of vaccine were available to cover all planned live exports of cattle, sheep and goats until the end of this year. “Anybody who wants to export must vaccinate, there will be no discussion,” Le Foll added. Last week, outbreaks of bluetongue were also reported in Slovenia, Austria and Turkey. Additional reporting by Thomas Hubert

	KUWAIT CITY, Dec 6, (KUNA): The Public Authority for Agriculture Affairs and Fish Resources (PAAAFR) has banned live bird imports from Tunisia and France for the outbreak of West Nile fever in the two countries. Acting PAAAFR Director General Nabila AlKhalil Faisal Al-Hasawi issued the decision on Sunday, providing that all incoming consignments will be subjected to the PAAAFR’s requirements and restrictions, in line with the relevant procedures of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the veterinary quarantine systems in Kuwait and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). In case infectious or epidemic diseases are spotted, a shipment will be rejected and the importer will be committed to return it to the source country, Al-Hasawi stressed.
The decision was taken against the backdrop of OIE recent reports on outbreak of WNF in Tunisia and France. Meanwhile, Kuwait Municipality’s Food Safety Commission has recommended lifting the ban on white meat imports from Italy, India, Turkey, Romania, and Bulgaria.
The decision was taken upon a resolution from the Public Authority for Agriculture Affairs and Fish Resources that was also based a report from the World Organization for Animal Health which declared these countries H1N1 free areas, said the Commission Head Fahad Al-Msabbehi said.
Al-Msebbehi, however, noted that the commission has ordered a ban on white meat imports from two African countries, namely Ghana and Ivory Coast, for having H1N1 cases. The commission also postponed a decision on lifting the ban on the importation of livestock meat from the EU countries due to the spread of the mad cow disease. It assigned the Public Authority for Agriculture Affairs and Fish Resources to conduct a thorough report about the lifting the ban on white meat importation from America.

“An abnormal mortality had led to the taking of samples for analysis by the Departmental Directorate of Population Protection,”ministry officials noted.
The sequencing of the strain is underway but it seems to be of a strain already detected in Europe, which until then had an low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) profile.
French Minister of Agriculture Stephane Le Foll immediately instructed his services to enable the national health emergency response plan in accordance with European and international rules. Protection zones and surveillance of 3 km and 10 km respectively for livestock are implemented.
In addition, monitoring of both livestock and wildlife will be stepped up.
The Animal Health Advisory Committee will have an emergency meeting on Nov. 26 to discuss the application of protection measures against the avian influenza.
According to the World Health Organization, H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or “bird flu”). Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60%.
The UN agency and Ministry of Agriculture also note that it is safe to eat properly prepared and cooked poultry and game birds. The virus is sensitive to heat. Normal temperatures used for cooking (so that food reaches 70°C in all parts) will kill the virus. As a standard precaution, WHO recommends that poultry, poultry products and wild game birds should always be prepared following good hygienic practices, and that poultry meat should be properly cooked.

 The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) recently released a rapid risk assessment because of avian influenza subtype H5, which has been detected in a flock of domestic birds in France.
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtypes A(H5N1) and A(H5N2) has been discovered in some commercial and backyard farms in the Dordogne region. There is always a possibility of the virus spreading to humans when people have exposure to contaminated birds. In this case, the ECDC’s assessment risk states that there is a very low risk of transmission from the poultry to humans.
There is also a chance that the virus can spread to other nations in Europe. This is because goods are imported and exported across borders, which could cause the virus to spread. The risk assessment reports that the risk of the virus spreading is low.
The 
Dordogne farm is currently in holding. Health officials have reported that this case shows an abnormal rate of mortality, which is what led to the detection of the virus. There may also be two additional cases of HPAI A(H5N2) on a commercial duck farm and a goose farm in Dordogne. These cases have not yet been confirmed by health officials.

PARIS, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- A case of avian influenza was confirmed Tuesday night in Dordogne, southwestern France, the French Ministry of Agriculture announced on Wednesday. 
""An abnormal mortality had led to the taking of samples for analysis by the Departmental Directorate of Population Protection,"" the ministry said in a press release. 
The case of avian influenza, along with its virus strain H5N1, was confirmed on Tuesday by the National Agency of Risks Assessment (ANSES), while ""the sequencing of the strain is underway"". 
But the ministry said ""it seems to be of a strain already detected in Europe, which had a low-pathogenic avian influenza profile"". 
Experts from ANSES are evaluating the potential dangerousness of the strain for man. 
French Minister of Agriculture Stephane Le Foll also immediately activated the national urgent sanitary intervention plan. 
According to the ministry, the Animal Health Advisory Committee will have an emergency meeting on Nov. 26 to discuss the application of protection measures against the avian influenza.

 France has been hit with four new cases of a bird flu outbreak in the south west of the country, bringing the total number of reported cases to 10.
 
 On Monday 7 December, the French Ministry of Agriculture announced six new cases of bird flu had been detected. Two days later it confirmed another four cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain had been discovered.This is the first bird flu outbreak in France
 for more than eight years, after the epidemic in 2006-07.A highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) H5N1 strain was first discovered in a family-run barnyard in south-western France this November.Destroyed Since the discovery in Dordogne – which has a highly-concentrated population of chicken and foie gras producers – the outbreak has been detected in two other regions: Haute-Vienne and Landes.When the virus was first detected, the government acted quickly to stop an isolated incident from developing. This clearly hasn’t worked; nine separate cases of AI have been reported in a fortnight.Around 24,376 birds have been destroyed by authorities to limit the pathogen’s deadly path of destruction. Of the culled birds, only 3% are believed to have been affected by the H5N1 strain, according to data provided by the World Health Organisation on Animal Health.Stop 'outbreak'France is taking no chances with this outbreak, though. According to The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Europe’s largest agricultural producer has imposed a range of damage-limitation measures. These include imposing quarantines on AI-hit farms, placing controls on the domestic movement of poultry and increasing surveillance and screening of poultry farms so far unaffected by the outbreak.In a statement made on Wednesday 9 November, the French government said: “The Ministry of Agriculture is working in cooperation with the all the departments concerned to pursue the deployment of protective measures to prevent the risk of disease spread and prevent further outbreaks of avian influenza.”The government also confirmed it will chair an emergency meeting with representatives of the poultry industry to discuss strategies to limit the spread of the outbreak. They will work together to help the poultry sector develop a robust strategy to safeguard poultry exports, which have been damaged after a string of non-EU countries banned imports of poultry products as well as live chickens.Algeria, China, Egypt, Japan, Morocco, South Korea, Thailand and Tunisia have all banned poultry from France so far.Reuters also reported that France has detected H5N2 and H5N9 strains among the recent cases. The French Ministry of Agriculture was unable to comment.

CHINA - China's poultry imports are expected to decrease from 2015's figure, according to estimates from the US Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS).The report forecasts 2016 broiler meat imports at 200 thousand tons, 7 per cent down from USDA’s 2015 official figure. 
This reduction is largely attributed to the ban on US imports over avian flu detections. Imports from South American countries will continue to benefit from the ban on US poultry and poultry products. 
Flu suspensions lifted on heat-treated products 
The US exported approximately $300 million in poultry meat and poultry products to China in 2014. 
However on January 9, 2015, China banned imports of US poultry and poultry related products because of highly pathogenic avian influenza detections in the United States. 
In response, the USDA sought exemptions for heat treated poultry products, such as chicken paws and rendered meals. Discussions with the Chinese government resulted in the lifting of the ban on US poultry meal and feather meal for use as feed ingredients in China’s livestock production. 
In accordance with accepted science and international standards, heat treatment of certain duration and temperature is sufficient to ensure destruction of any virus. 
Prior to the detection of HPAI in the United States, China maintained suspensions of US poultry meat and poultry product imports from five states, due to low-pathogenic avian influenza. 
This policy is inconsistent with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) guidelines, which do not recommend trade suspensions due to low pathogenicity avian influenza detections. 
 
Exports expected to remain level 
The report forecasts China’s 2016 broiler meat exports at 430,000 tons, no change from USDA's 2015 official estimates. 
Exports to Japan, China’s main export destination, are expected to continue to decline as lingering food safety concerns have caused Japanese buyers to seek other sources for poultry, such as Thailand. 
Japan and Hong Kong are the main export destinations for China’s poultry products. China mainly exports cooked or preserved broiler meat products. 
Although exports are expected to remain flat in the near term, China’s skilled workers and some state-of-the art facilities give it a competitive advantage in regional markets such as Japan and Hong Kong.

FRANCE - Three more outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been reported in France, bringing the total number of outbreaks to thirteen.In Landes, an outbreak of the H5N9 strain in Horsarieux was detected in a breeding flock of over three and a half million chickens, ducks and guinea fowl. 
Another H5N9 outbreak was found further south, in Arroses in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques region. It affected 1500 breeding ducks. 
Finally, a H5N2 outbreak in Manciet in the Gers region (see map below) was detected in a flock of 8300 breeding ducks. 250 of the birds died and the rest were destroyed. 
Thousands of birds have already died and been destroyed in these outbreaks. 
A third outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza has also been reported. The H5N2 outbreak occurred in Castelnau de Mandailles in Aveyron region, and affected a flock of 6120 ducks, which were all destroyed.

Five of the outbreaks happened on Dec 14, 2 in Dordogne and 3 in Landes, while the rest were reported yesterday.All outbreaks were attributed to H5 strains, but the exact strain was not specified for any of them. So far H5N1, H5N2, and H5N9 HPAI strains have been confirmed in the previous 15 outbreaks.The new strain identified in an OIE report yesterday is low-pathogenic H5N3, which was detected on three farms that are not included in France's other 30 outbreaks. Two of the farms are in Landes, and the other is in the Pyrenees-Atlantiques region, both in far southwestern France.The farms house from 570 to 1,430 poultry, and the outbreaks began on Dec 6 and Dec 8. Tests conducted as part of countrywide surveillance came back positive for H5N3 on Dec 10 and Dec 13. As is typical with low-path avian flu, no birds were culled to contain the spread of the virus.H5N1 in Vietnam, NigeriaIn Vietnam, meanwhile, HPAI H5N1 avian flu has struck a backyard flock of 42,000 poultry, killing 1,900 birds, according to a separate OIE report today. The surviving birds were culled to prevent disease spread.The outbreak began on Dec 3 in Viung Tua province in the south, and authorities have implemented their usual response measures, such as disinfecting the premises.In Nigeria, two separate OIE reports yesterday detailed three H5N1 outbreaks in poultry. The first report detailed two outbreaks in the southern states of Edo and Lagos. The first outbreak, which began Dec 11, affected a farm of 3,150 chickens and turkeys in Edo and resulted in the loss of 580 birds, with the remainder of the flock culled.The Lagos outbreak involved 1,800 egg-laying chickens, of which 300 were felled by the virus. All surviving chickens were euthanized. That outbreak began Dec 12.The third Nigerian outbreak also began Dec 12, in Kaduna state in the north, according to a second OIE report filed by Nigerian officials. The affected farm housed 7,500 laying hens, and H5N1 killed 1,500 of them. The remaining 6,000 birds were culled to prevent disease spread.Both Vietnam and Nigeria have been hit by multiple H5N1 outbreaks this year.Minnesota lifts quarantinesThe Minnesota Board of Animal Health (MBAH) said it has lifted the last quarantines on poultry farms that were infected with HPAI earlier this year, the Associated Press (AP) reported yesterday.MBAH said 90% of the 108 infected farms were cleared to restock birds on Oct 6, and now the remaining 10% are cleared.

 Bird flu in France has reached “crisis” stage, according to the French government, after the total number of bird flu cases hit 30 this week. 
 
 Outbreaks of various highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) strains have tripled in a week as France confirmed its poultry sector was now in “crisis” during the worst possible time – the busy and financially positive run-up to Christmas and New Year.France’s bird flu outbreaks have developed progressively as three cases of the low pathogenic H5N3 strain were detected in three separate farms in the south west of the country. What this means is that bird flu is now a multi-strain crisis in France with cases of the H5N1, H5N2 and H5N9 strain all having been reported in a fortnight.Strains of H5N3 were discovered on two farms in the Landes area of south-western France with the others being found in the Pyrenées-Atlantiques. The detections were made after French health officials ran a nationwide surveillance campaign of poultry farms as fears that the virus could spread took hold.
The emergence of four different pathogenic strains in such a short time was described as “unprecedented” by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) on Wednesday 16 December. One possible hypothesis for the rapid spread is that the low pathogenic strains have evolved into highly pathogenic ones, according to the OIE.No 'risk'  Despite the developments in the bird flu outbreak, the French government has been quick to remind consumers that they are safe. “There is no risk to human health,” a farm minster for France said on Wednesday 16 December. The government official also added that the discovery of the low-pathogenic strain would have “no impact on our [the French Government’s] management of the crisis”.Since France’s first bird flu outbreak in eight years
 was reported by GlobalMeatNews just over a fortnight ago, a string of countries have banned imports of poultry. Japan and China remain the most worrying ones for France, as the two Asian states are big importers of foie gras.Other countries to have imposed a ban on poultry products
 and live chickens include Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, South Korea, Thailand and Tunisia.

 Bird flu cases in France double in less than a week
 
 Wednesday 23 December 2015 10:06 
 
 © Burger/Phanie/Rex/ShutterstockCases of bird flu in France have doubled since Friday, with the Ministry of Agriculture announcing a total of 61 early yesterday afternoon (22 December) compared with 30 at the end of last week.
In a web statement, the ministry said the 61 cases now covered six regions in south-west France, with the Haute-Pyrenees department the latest to have recorded cases close to the Spanish border.
Although the French agriculture minister Stephane Le Foll said the outbreak was under control, farmers in the Landes region, which has 27 cases, have now lost tens of thousands of chickens, geese and ducks.

However, the sequencing of the H5N1 strain detected in the first outbreak in the Dordogne at the end of November has confirmed the absence of key markers, meaning there is no danger to humans, the ministry confirmed.
Meanwhile, the risk of bird flu spreading from France to the UK remains “low but heightened”, according to the latest analysis published by the Animal Plant Health Agency (APHA).
Professor Ian Brown, APHA head of virology, and Dr Helen Roberts, of APHA’s international disease monitoring team, said the risk to the UK as a result of the French outbreaks was primarily around pathways which involve “lapses in biosecurity or trade routes, rather than through wild birds”.
The pair said the French outbreaks were wholly of European origin.
“The situation in France simply reinforces what we already know that low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses [LPAI] circulate in wild birds and cause occasional spillover outbreaks in poultry.
“These may be difficult to detect in domestic waterfowl species and they may then mutate into [highly pathogenic avian influenza (HAPI)] viruses.
“The cases in a France may be related but whether the index case for LPAI and HPAI mutation has been found is unclear.”
In the run-up to Christmas, the agency reminded poultry keepers to maintain high standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant and report any signs of animals showing sickness.

This brings to four the number of EU countries affected – with the Netherlands and the UK also hit – and are the seventh and eighth confirmed cases in the EU since early November.

The latest outbreak in Italy occurred on a turkey fattening unit in Porto Viro, near Venice. According to a report from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), mortality reached 3.81% on the farm, in a flock of 31,985 birds.
Culling began on 16 December as part of a “stamping out” policy, and restriction zones were established.
The second German case has appeared on a turkey farm in Lower Saxony, the Federal Research Institute for Animal Health has confirmed. It is the same H5N8 strain previously found on a turkey farm in north-east Germany.
Federal agriculture minister, Christian Schmidt, has appealed to all poultry farmers to step up their biosecurity to prevent further spread.
Global spread
Outside of Europe, recent AI outbreaks have occurred in the USA (H5N2 in wild ducks and H5N8 in a captive falcon), Canada (H5N2 in five flocks of broiler breeders and turkeys in British Columbia), Japan (H5N8 in a wild crane), and India (H5N1 in a flock of 5,974 ducks in the far south of the country).
But, according to the European Food Safety Authority, the route of infection in Europe remains uncertain.
“It is plausible that the virus has entered poultry farms indirectly, through material contaminated by infected wild birds – such as human activities, movement of vehicles or equipment,” it says.
“As all affected farms use indoor housing facilities, experts conclude that a direct transmission from wild birds to farmed poultry is unlikely.”
There are no known direct migration routes from East Asia to Europe, it adds. “One hypothesis is that infected migratory birds from East Asia transmit the virus to other species at breeding and stopover places in Eurasia, but this hypothesis needs further investigation.”
Animal welfare group Compassion in World Farming recently urged people not make wild birds a scapegoat when looking for the source of H5N8.
“The risk of simply blaming wild birds is twofold,” it said. “First, it could divert attention and resources away from other issues, such as the fact that intensive indoor farms are ideal incubators for avian influenza.
“Second, there is a danger that some may call for a cull of wild birds, which would have serious consequences not only for those birds, but also for the ecosystems they are part of.”

CHINA - A total of 51 positive findings of five subtypes of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) have been reported and confirmed across China. The Chinese veterinary authority reported all the outbreaks to the World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE) on 24 October. All outbreaks were reported as starting on 12 September and subsequently resolved, presumably because of a national campaign for surveillance testing on that day. 
Each report describes the finding of a different viral subtype. 
One Immediate Notification outlines 16 outbreaks of 'clicncal disease' casued by HPAI strain H5N1 detected in ducks, geese and chickens located in markets across China in the provinces of Guangxi, Qinghai, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Hunan and Jiangsu. There was a total of 18 virus-positive tests.

A total of 24 outbreaks of clinical disease caused by HPAI strain H5N6 have been reported and confirmed in a Follow Up Report No. 2. The positive samples were obtained at markets and on one farm affecting ducks, geese and chickens in the provinces of Zheijiang, Hunan, Hebei, Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Chingking, Guanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Tibet and Hubei. One outbreak at Heilongjiang involved two positive tests in a flock of 1,421 birds, all of which were destroyed. 
The only previous outbreak of this virus type was on 23 August in Heilongjiang. 
 
H5N6 reported across China 
 
The fifth report from China dated 24 October is a Follow Up Report No.3, which outlines eight outbreaks of clinical disease caused by HPAI strain H5N2 detected in chickens and ducks. Six of these were from markets in Hubei, Guangxi, Liaoning,and Tibet, while two were presumably on farms. A total of 2,333 birds were destroyed after two of them were found to be positive for the virus in Heilongjiang province and in Ningxia, 3,920 birds were destroyed after four of them tested positive.

 The H5N8 strain has never been detected in humans but has led to massive culling of animals in countries affected. South Korea had to slaughter millions of farm birds to try to contain an outbreak there.
 
 China and Japan also reported cases of the H5N8 virus earlier this year.Germany had not been hit by a highly pathogenic form of avian influenza since 2009. In that year it reported cases of H5N1, a different strain that can be transmitted from birds to humans and had caused the death of nearly 400 people in the world as of July 2014, according to World Health Organization (WHO) data.

 A highly pathogenic H5N8 strain of avian influenza has been isolated on a turkey farm in the north east of Germany – the first confirmed case on the European continent.
According to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), the outbreak occurred in Heinrichswalde, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, north-east Germany. The WOAH has confirmed 31,000 turkeys for fattening have been culled.

It is understood the outbreak was confined to a single shed on a holding in the region, and the birds were 16 weeks old.
In accordance with EU policy, a 3km “protection zone” and a 10km “surveillance zone” have been set up around the site. Sources have suggested culling is under way on all poultry in the protection zone.
The two zones will remain in force until at least 22 December.
Local media reported that all poultry within a 50km radius are to be kept penned in and animals in a 3km radius are undergoing extensive testing.
Symptoms of the H5N8 virus were first identified over the weekend, and tests confirming the strain led to the culling of the flock on 6 November.
The cause of the infection has not yet been established.
The WOAH notification said movement controls have been placed on poultry in the country. Further details are expected to emerge in the coming days.

 Symptoms of the highly pathogenic Avian Influenza, commonly referred to as Bird Flu or H5N1, has been found at a turkey farm Saturday in the Sharon Region in Israel. 
 
In response to the discover, the Agriculture Ministry began culling 40,000 at the farm. The farm was closed off after an initial positive result came back from laboratory tests and concerns arose that neighboring farms might have been affected by the highly contagious disease. 
 
The discovery of H5N1 at the farm near the town of Kibbutz Magal came less than a week after it was found at another turkey farm in northern Israel on Monday, the first case in nearly three years. 
 
The World World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reported that the virus found at a turkey fattening farm in the village of Avi'el which is south of the city of Haifa led to the culling of 15,000 birds including another 61,000 turkeys at a nearby farm. 
 
The Agriculture Ministry said that ""the culling of all the flocks is ongoing. Backyard birds in the village will also be culled.""

530;93;530;DA bans poultry imports from Israel;http://www.philstar.com/business/2015/02/15/1423755/da-bans-poultry-imports-israel;"MANILA, Philippines - The Department of Agriculture (DA) has temporarily banned the importation of domestic and wild birds and their products from Haifa, Israel after a reported outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in turkey fattening farms in the area.
Through memorandum order 4, Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala banned the entry of poultry meat, day-old chicks, eggs and semen from Haifa.
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reported that an outbreak of H5N1 HPAI virus was monitored in turkey fattening farms in Avi’el, Hadera, Haifa as of Jan. 14.
This was confirmed by the Kimron Vetrinary Institute, Avian Diseases Laboratory, after real-time polymerase chain reaction tests.
The OIE Animal Health Information Department said the H5 HPAI virus is among the notifiable OIE-listed terrestrial animal diseases, infections and infestations in force in 2014.
The Agriculture department has, therefore, suspended the processing, evaluation of application and issuance of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Import Clearance to import such products from said location.

With the exception of heat-treated products with slaughter or production date before Oct. 31, 2014, all other such shipments originating from the mentioned location would be seized to prevent entry into the country.
“Our poultry subsector grossed P189.7 billion last year, or 7.84 percent higher than in 2013. We cannot afford then to lose this growth foothold to avian diseases, that is why we are keen on monitoring entry of products that could threaten the health of our poultry industry,” Alcala said.
The domestic poultry sector is one of the strongest farm subsector in the country, having remained free from bird flu that affected neighboring Asian countries.
The OIE is an inter-governmental organization that functions to inform governments of the occurrence of animal diseases and of ways to control these diseases.
It also conducts studies devoted to the surveillance and control of animal diseases and of harmonizing regulations to facilitate trade in animals and animal products.
